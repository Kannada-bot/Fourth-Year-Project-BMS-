  Like1) picture quality superb..sd channel looks like hd... No issue.2) i love smart mirror option ....smooth connection with mobile.3)sound quality is good.I think in dis price range its a good choice........Luv  u samsung......

  TV continuously blinks for every 5 min.Service engineers stats that the issue with with set top box.I was using the same set top box for my previous LED TV aswell but never faced such issue.Looks like there is a issue / defect with the TV when connecting SD set top boxIts very sad that Service engineers are not accepting the defect in TV.i am going to buy a new HD Set top box and check.But its very sad that no where its written that this TV works only with HD connections.

"
"

  Product is good but the service engineer Mr. Santosh Prasad was so rude with lack of knowledge. He hanged the TV but not tell how to operate. Stated that u can read the mannual this is not my job. Im unsatisfied with sansung service. I give 0 star for services provided by samsung.

"
"

  This is just a LED Tv with smart option!!! The picture quality is worst I would say... yes the sound output is good... if you see a character with strip shirt or something like that the picture image would be shaky...that would hurt your eyes , I had to sell it with 1 day at a loss of 2 thousand... as amazon does not hv a return policy... please read return terms and conditions before purchasing...if ur looking a low budget tv with smart options please go ahead....

"

  After lots of research I found this as a best one, as it is HD ready, u see pixelated when u r too close. All the apps are working fine without any lag. Even 480p quality  YouTube videos look good. It can play high quality videos too. If you are using govt cable tv setup box, make sure your cable connections is good. And don't use AV cable to connect ur setup box with tv, Highly recommend to use HDMI cable to get good audio and video quality as I seen the difference as well I've posted it. I was using tizum and terabyte cable. The later is 144 rupees only. Bluetooth remote is also extremely useful. U can use urs mobile app also to share and control your TV.

  No blutooth connectivity as claimed in product description. Video quality is also poor.

  Tv picture quality is as expected, I received a TV with speakers which lasted for 2 hours, post which it stopped working, raised a ticket Samsung dealer closed the ticket stating called no response... that a lie .... later 7 days passed one Good engineer came respectful man... mentioned to replace mother board .... after 7 days we get to know pasts are not in stock,  we will refund your amount post deprecation... this is cause a loss to the customer time waste and unwanted stress... and all is blamed on lockdown :-) now the TV is out of stock looks like a Failer model for Samsung. Now the real pain begins Samsung is ready to refund the invoice amount in the form of a Samsung Cupon and we can only buy Samsung products from Samsung plaza... and no stock of 32 inches ... service team is calling and adding pressure stating we need the TV back... and no replacement... cash back ..no stock in samsung plaza....customers money ... but a hard and fast rule only to buy samsung this is like fooling on daylight.... highly disappointed... never again Samsung !

"
"

  I am facing issue with this TV, it get automatically switch off and comes on after couple of secs. This is happening frequently now. I would suggest, please don't purchase this TV until SAMSUNG confirms that they resolved the issue.

"
"

  Many features are missing. Tried to return. They said that it can't be returned if it wud have any demages then only it is possible.. not happy with the product

"

   This is my third LED TV and it is one of the best in this price. As compare to price features are comparatively very good. Below are some like and dislikes about itPros:- High quality pictures and video- Seamless video streaming from Netflix Amazon Hotstar YouTube and many more...- Its music player is customisable and its inbuilt Amplifier options is super.- Loud sound, till now playing with volume max to 50, i don't dare for 100 as neighbour will kick me out ;)- 4Gb of storage space allows lots of application installation.- TV has 2 HDMI ports & 1 USB ports.- Connectivity options included are HDMI , WIFI.- You can connect various gadgets such as your laptop using the HDMI port and Bluetooth.- you can access your cloud and can bring your work on big screen- Alexa and Bixby is inbuilt voice search options- interface is very user friendly, with in few hours you will get to know your TV- Customer service is excellent, installation done with in 3 hr of delivery. He checked it thoroughly before installing and provide full demo- Cloud option for gaming is one of the best featureCons:- Limited number of apps- Most of my favourite apps i can't install like Amazon Music (as per few websites it will be available soon), no app where we can get all tv content either paid or unpaid- If you are fan of cable content then definitely you need satellite TV connection , no other options- i am facing issue with screen sharing, it is not detected by my phone once i am disconnect from screen sharing. Other TV in my neighborhood are visible for screen sharing. When i reboot it then only i am able to connect.

  Though there are many other TV with more options and less price, i preferred to chose Samsung as its a standard brand but this product is not satisfactoryCons:1. Sound system isn’t that good you have to keep reducing the volume as BGMs sounds more than the actual speach2. Doesn’t fit for all types of home theatre3. No playstore (I might missed to see this before buying it)

"
"

  Picture quality is good and sound is great but it has some bluetooth connectivity problem with my bluetooth speakers (F&D) sometimes it's not able to transfer the audio and we need to delete and repair the speaker again & again.Casting is good but only with the Samsung mobile I have one Mi Note 5 and it's not able to pair with that one.Auto Backup Features is good but sometimes it's not run automatically and we need to start it manually to copy the data and sometimes it copies the same data for multiple times and create multiple copies of the same file in the USB.Only two Voice assistants are there BIXBY & ALEXA and both are only working when you are connected with the Internet while in Other Android TV the Google Assistant works offline too.Overall the TV is good in this Price range.

"
"

  The best TV under 15000 Rupees.1.It has brilliant sound output2 Installation is very easy3.User interface is good but don't expect super fluid interface like Android,at this price it is great.4.Great picture quality but connect proper HD dish connection for superb picture quality.5.Great build quality with good finishing of colour,I opted for grey colour,it is looking pemuim.6.Provided remote is simple and has useful featured buttons.""Overall this is the best TV under Rs.15000"".A big thanks to Samsung for such awesome budget TV""...The only thing I didn't like is packaging,hope Amazon should take proper care on packaging....

"

  Very Good LED TV in this price range. This is my first ever review on Amazon. Please don't buy TV like MI, Motorola, VU etc which are purely chinese made. A TV should be like a TV which purely performs in picture and sound segment and on DTH as well. This TV outperforms all its equivalent TV. Blindly go for it. Boots up within seconds. SD channel looks like HD channels. Mirroring is super fine. Be rest assured you won't require an external speaker. Even at 50 % sound is like home theatre. One year additional warranty by Samsung. It will definetly thwart Chinese brands out of market.

"
"

  The 32 inch Samsung Smart TV is a complete failure. It became mute on the second day and I have been waiting for a week for Amazon to replace or refund. They initially schedulded a technician visit for Aug 13, but postponed it to 17th while the return window closes on 19th. There is no place to contact, no mail or phone other than the call center or web site and there are no messages to confirm receipt of the customer complaint. You are not even publishing my genuine review and grievances for public benefit. I feel cheated.

  2020 best Tv. Nice purchase. Good Quality and specification. Tizen store. Some applications not available.  But this is enough.I purchased this for Rs.14000.Best price and best company.Alexa working very well.Sound quality best as 20 W. Good and enough.Picture quality awesome. Clear and crispy.New model remote.

"
"

  Hi Amazon, Samsung TV is very good and excellent picture quality( HD Channels only)  as well as sound quality also. No Bluetooth optional available.  No 3.5 mm audio output jack available but availble optical Digital output audio.  TV Build quality also good. Finally I loved this new series Samsung Tv with voice search..  In Television section , Samsung and Sony companies are top. Samsung is always Samsung.. If any body wants to purchase please go, don't think and hesitate.Thank you Amazon and Samsung.

  Big mistake by buying from amazon after arrival on 16th day TV stopped working when we called Samsung their engineer visited and informed faulty piece and when we asked Samsung to replace they asked us to contact from whom we bought tv tats amazon when we contacted amazon they denying to help any furtherNever buy electronics from AMAZON

"
"

  Got defective product. Display is not working after installation.Tried to called Amazon support and samsung support. But they are not taking responsibility to replace or return the item.

  Smart TV by Samsung.Most affordableNetflix, Prime, Zee5, YouTube,amazon primeTakes a bit of time to boot. But bluetooth is not supported. And sound quality , pictures quality everything is is goodPaid only 14,000/-

  Very good TV in this price. More interesting thing is this Works very well with Apple TV .

  DON'T BUY SAMSUNG TV. DON'T USE AMAZON FOR ONLINE SHOPPING!!!!Here is my whole experience or rather the nightmare.I bought the TV, It has brightness issues. The TV screen is dull even at max brightness. I reported the same to AMAZON. They arranged a tech visit for 4th Aug which never happened, wasted whole day for that visit. They rearranged it for 6th, the tech came and saw the issue they agreed, restarted updated the TV, still the issue was there. I enquired do they agree that issue is there they said Yes. Same evening I called customer support and got the Info that in their system the issue has been updated by the tech firm as resolved. I was dejected and felt cheated. After many hours of calls I was able to get my call transferred to the managers but both the times AMAZON disconnected my call. They kept on sending me messages for feedback. In their system the first visit resolved the issue. One of the customer care executives told me I was supposed to get the report in written from the tech which they did not gave me and did not tell me about. Don't buy this product and even if you want to buy from Flipkart. Samsung and Amazon has degraded their quality. Beware of tech company QDIGI they are the ones responsible for tech visits, read their reviews and you will know. And whats funny is Amzon is still letting them work.

"

  I am writing this review after 2 week's of usage. I am not a very fond of cable which provides so many unwanted channels.Completely wonder entertainment if you are usingWiFi connection. Good to have preloaded Zee5, Netflix & YouTube what else you require. Prompt delivery and free installation makes you feel very happy by Samsung. only cos i found its 20watt speaker op. Yes but we have alternate solutions for this.

"

  The TV is faulty item. It  is an under quality product.  It produces buzzing sound and sound stops after every 1 hour or so. Seller has shipped a faulty item and it needs to be resolved by Amazon since TV was bought at amazon.com and not via SAMSUMG. Contacted the Customer support agents were not helpful at all and did not want to file a report against the  seller since they are shipping under quality product. After 20 mins of back and forth via phone call, The leadership team at amazon only filed some voice of customer form.  It is hard to wrap my head around the fact if amazon guys are shipping  an under quality product and  supporting those sellers and making customers run from pillar to post.. Why have the seller on your platform ? Does Amazon stand for harassing the customers and false advertisement ?  Why can't Amazon guys talk to seller and have the matter solved.. The agent was not even ready to report the seller. Kept on telling me to talk to Samsung. Executives at amazon's are not paying heed to anything just making money with fat bonuses for false advertisement and making customers unhappy for no fault of theirs

  No Samsung tape in Samsung tv box. So I have doubt for original tv received or not?

"
"

  Goods :1. Good Picture Quality2. 20 W Speaker output, good enough for a mid size room3. Fast installation - NOTE : Wall mount does not come in the box, it is brought by the installation engineer.4. easy to set up.5. For Samsung phone users, Smart View makes casting to screen very easy.Bads:1. You have to call Samsung for installation. does not happen by default. Reason for 1 less star.2. Prime App is very slow.3. Keeping a watch, it shut down twice on it's own.

"
"

  First of all it’s Made in Vietnam & not in China which was one of the main reasons I chose this one over any other TV.1. Box comes with TV, Remote, stand, power cable, 2 batteries & quick guide. March-2020 model with 2 star on energy efficiency ratings. The remote is sleek & curved and has an awesome feel While using.2. Installation happened the very second day post delivery. Executive who came was very professional. Even when they drill the wall they ensure your room remains dust free. Executive offers Samsung insurance extension for 1,2 & 3 years at a nominal price of around ₹1600 for a year. (I opted for AC ko third party with TV)3. Mind well this is Tizen OS And not Android. Make sure to update your TV OS once you get it.4. You can use screen mirroring on iPhone & android.5. Sound is the only option where TV can probably score a bit better6. You can install smart things app from Samsung and use your mobile as a remote.7. 30 days free trial of Netflix, Prime & Zee 5 is also included. Incase you have subscription already it does get extended.Overall an awesome TV to buy in this price range. It’s a excellent product & indeed has a very good value for money.

  Picture was ok and bought it for vfm. It was a good deal but the sound was defective. Requested replacement but replacement was not available. So product returned. Would be satisfied if the product was working. Delivery experience was good.

"
"

  I bought one Samsung 43"" in Feb and after good experience of 4 months I bought this one So no question on quality. Got installed in 4 hours of receiving it which was another good part of service. Inbuilt Alexa and got discount of 1750 so its a wonderful deal.

"
"

  Delivery is on time but the people who come for fitting are rude , Ill Mannered and have ZERO sense of timing“ this is how we work “ is what they say !

"
"

  As usual, product received on time, thanks to Amazon for the timely delivery. The box packaging was neat. I have installed this in my bedroom and it looks sweet. I purchased the Voice Control version. Let's talk about the pros and cons.Pros:1) Multiple voice recognition options as mentioned.2) Major OTT apps available but nor all. Apps like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Zee5, Apple TV+, Apple Music is pre-installed. Available apps on Samsung store are Disney+ Hotstar, Google Play Movies, Sony LIV, Voot. No Discovery+ yet. There are plenty of other apps, but I didn't find them useful.3) Decent picture quality at the price.4) Free TV wall mount, through Samsung Installation technician.5) Stylish remote, loved the way it is designed.6) Plays 1080p videos well in the 720p frame.7) Dual-band wifi. 2.4 and 5 GHz.Cons:1) Audio quality is average given the 20-watt speakers.2) Should have been a 1080p instead of 720p.3) Price slightly higher as compared to other competitors.This is based on a 2-day usage. Will update more as and when.

  I'm a simple middle class man, been using samsung appliances since more than 2 decades, this is my 1st tv, we had an old crt tv which was also of samsung, it was superb, and this is our new and first smart tv, we were tempted by vu and mi but apprehensive of chinese brands, so went for the safe choice, this has voice search which is really useful, installation happened on the same day of delivery. Tv Stand comes with tv but wall mount (also free) comes when samsung guy comes home to install. Tv looks good, works well, this is initial review, i will update you whenever i have something to say.

"
"

  The product was delivered before scheduled date and in good condition. And thanks for that. But tv wall mount kit for not in the box.Please let me know why it was not sent along with TV set.

"
"

   Every things matching with product description / details, Very nice picture quality with HDMI Cable but audio (sound) quality is poor but little bit of improve with auto / amplifier mode in settings otherwise can use bluetooth speaker / HDMI Arc audio tether system / external speaker with Settopbox (STB), and when use as personal computer wirelessly that time its delay or lagging, Over all it's value for money still still it's working and hope it will work for long time and A Suggestion - give some rest for 30 minutes or above if it's used for long time a day (on Dated 04-08-2020)

"

  The product that I received is a defective one.No sound coming from tv.PICTURE QUALITY  IS GOOD.smart features as expected are good.I ordered it on 19sep and it was delivered on 21sep and the technician came on 22sep and then we found that sound is not coming from TV.He tried all reset settings and factory reset settings but still the problem persisted.Then he suggested me 2 options.1) They(Samsung,) open the TV and will rectify the error2)To returnAs it is a brand new TV and I thought to return.I have put request for return and then Amazon customer care contacted me and he said that an Amazon technician would visit and he himself gives a report and then they will consider replacement.so he ordered inspection service and it was scheduled for 24sep but on 24th morning I received a message that inspection service order was canceled.Today ie on 24sep I have again put the same return request and again the Amazon customer care called me and I explained him everything.He said he once again put inspection order and it is scheduled again for 25sep.I hope he comes.It was a surprise for me.I have been purchasing online since many years but a product like TV,a defective one?Didn't expect this and I hope it will be rectified soonThe technician visited on 25th sep and again customer care person contacted me and he said TV will be replaced on 29th sep.He said the same person will bring a new TV and he takes back defected one.I got replacement on 29th and got fitted on 30th sep.For the price,Picture quality and sound quality are very good.smart features are good.The TV has adaptive display like we have in mobile.Satisfied with the product

"
"

  Picture, Sound and Connectivity of this model is awesome at this price. Delivery delayed by a week due to lockdown but amazon has robust communication mechanism and informed me about  shipment status. Wall mounted TV next day of delivery by Samsung Engineer and found very prompt response without extra charges.Must buy TV in this price and well ahead compared to Chinese TV in overall quality. One remote, Good voice recognition, Dolby music system, lag free performance and easy user interface are unique features of Samsung wondertainment tv. Afterall brand is brand and quality matters.

"
"

  Absolutely horrible tv!!! PLEASE DO NOT BUY! Defective product was delivered. Blurry display with flickering lines on the screen at all times. Also, the refund process was a big headache as I had to constantly be in touch with Samsung as they weren't giving be a job sheet which was required by amazon to initiate a refund. Also, even after me telling Amazon and giving proof in form of videos did not initiate a refund and made a regular customer suffer!

"
"

  So I am writing this review after a month the the major points you should know about this  product are..Pro.1. Best display in this price range.2. Support all mazor application like YouTube, hotstar,Netflix, amazon prime,jiocinema..etc3.Non Chinese product.4.superb remote with voice assistant(Bixby,Alexa).5.fast os better than mid range android TV's.Cons1.jio tv application  is not supported2.sound quality is average

"
"

  good choice in this proce range getting samsung better than mi and those Chinese brands

"
"

  Pros-Good picture quality.-At 20W speaker sound is also good-Can be easily connected with Bluetooth devises.USB port working well. No format issue with pendrive.-No issue in wifi connection (even in connecting mobile hotspot)-Very good and quick installation service by SamsungCons-As it is not android TV you cannot download app like VLC media player which will help us to play video which is of different format.-Voice recognition needs improvement. (However in you tube app it works perfectly).

"
"

  This tv is very good at this price1 picture quality excellent2 smart connectivity also very good.3 sound is sufficient and clear.for 10/10 ft room 20% volume is is enough.

"
"

  TV stopped working within 7 days. Now these amazon ppl are happy for not assisting as the return policy has expired. Contacted Samsung, they say motherboard has a problem raise it with Amazon.Pathetic... Have been buying a lot of products from Amazon... NOT AGAIN

"
"

   After researching for 2 months I placed an order for this T.v.The voice quality is superb and the display colours are soothing and not irritating to eyes.Our WiFi router is placed a little far ...but still the videos run without buffering on high quality.If you are looking for a 32 inch smart tv undoubtedly you can go for this.The customer service is 24*7 and that's a relief as you know your query would be handled. For the other brands before buying I had tried contacting for a normal query buy they either weren't available or had no interest in ansering. But Samsung customer service par excellwnce.

"
"

  I was little apprehensive about the delivery, as ""Delhivery"" is quite infamous. But to my delight, it was delivered in perfect condition. The installation was quick too.Even if you are using an SD dish tv, it works well with no blur.Sound is good for a medium sized room, smart things app is pretty handy in case the remote is away and you are lazy :P.I absolutely love the tune station showcase mode.Cons :TV takes up like 2-3 mins to start up in the first few starts, but this doesn't happen later.voice recognition doesn't provide much of a use advantage.There is no data saver mode, but the tv is not consuming a lot of data so it is alright.Overall, this tv is absolutely worth it.

"
"

  Well, you won't get better TV in this price range.Picture clarity is as good as it gets with 720p screens. You will need to change couple of settings when it starts fresh but rest all is just fine.I have a Sony Bravia which is 1080p. And Sony is better in every segment as it comes with 1080p resolution plus bravia Engine but Samsung is very well designed and offers a good enough package when compared to Sony. Sound is great as well. Tizen OS is smooth and gives you great experience, the only problem here is, you don't get many apps. Choices are less. Amazon firestick offers more apps.I don't know why but Remote which comes with TV is not same for everyone. Possibly there are 2 types of remotes, 1 with that Circular button which has very less buttons. Where in which I got has too many buttons on it, this buttons are so small, it's a hassle to type with them. Believe me you will get irritated to use the remote in night when lights are off.You can control the tv somewhat with mobile app that samsung provides. It's pretty nice and the UI is well developed. But all you can do is change apps, close, volume control and tv on/off. You can't control inside of any app.Built quality is good. Parts are tough. Samsung will provide installation free of cost for wall mount.To conclude : You can go for it if you want smart TV. It's made in India/Vietnam.

"

  Product are good but Led TV wall hangings items i didn't find in the Box.

"
"

   The first time I bought the tv, it was defective and there was a problem with the display. Amazon knowledged the problem and immediately refunded. When the tv came back in stock, I ordered again. Installation happened on the same day and picture quality is really good. Love the features for the price point.Personally, I feel its the best tv for the price point.

"
"

  Really loved it. Screen mirroring is awesome.I can watch you tube,prime,zee5 ,Netflix hotstar. I didn't check this with USB.Overall it's a good product bought it for 13999. But delivery period took 17 days  except this remaining everything is so good.

"
"

"
"

  such a perfect & durable quality is provided by samsung.....picture quality and its all smart feature is at its best.....onl;y one thing is wrong in its product description. there is no google assistance feature in this mode...they shows that 3 voice command assistance is there but actually that is wrong...only two is there...one is samsung own system and another one is alexa.....other wise other all information is matched with the actual product....and in this price this tv is worth to buy...

"
"

  A very good TV at this price, with the features it has.

"
"

  awesome tv... very good with connectivity it supports iPhone's screen mirror out of the box very satisfied if you are looking for 32inch smart tv just close your eye and buy this model don't have any other second thoughts. the remote of the tv can be used to control other devices connected

"
"

  Bought it on aug 4, It stoped working after a week, till now they won’t respond properly and they were unable to repair or replace. Pathetic service by SamsungWorst product not even work for 10 days

"
"

  Not expected from Samsung. TV stopped working within 20days. Top of that I raised a service ticket with samsung, no one contacted for weeks, technician visited after week, said he will replace motherboard and will inform once part is available. The next week ticket closed without informing me and closed saying its successfully repaired TV with all quality checks are passed.Do not trust Samsung products and service, very bad experience. I will think twice buying from Amazon, second-order cancelled without intimation.

"
"

   Quality product  ,Samsung installation service goo

"
"

  Using it from last 10 daysNice picture qualitySound is goodSupports many OTT apps such as YouTube, Netflix, Sony LIV, Hotstar, amazon Prime, voot, zee5, and many moreAlso support phone Casting, bluetooth and WiFi

"
"

   Till the installation it was nice but when I opened Microsoft 365, on the white screen I saw something moving here and there. It is a cockroach moving here and there on the screen of my TV. The Technician from Samsung told me to have a replacement but amazon is not providing the replacement even  I called with-in four hours of the installation.

"
"

  I expected lot on the quality of the samsung but after using for a month there is a problem in display. A line zig zag is appearing on the screen. I request to replacement or repair at the earliest.

"
"

  Thanks very much to Samsung and Amazon too. Picture quality is really awesome if you watch in HD channels and picture quality is very good on SD channels also. Sound quality is also very good. I am really very happy to buy this product at very reasonable price . I suggest this is the best product if you looking to buy at this range.

"
"

  The most horrible tv and horrible customer service of Amazon, the tv's app store doesn't have a single video player to play movies from a pen drive, the bluetooth connectivity is name sake as the sound is distorted(i have tried 3 bluetooth devices), I cannot connect my sound bar as there is no option of coaxial cable in tv, also the tv speaker sound cracks on high volume, I want a different brand tv for the same price, turns out even that is not an option, I will never order anything from Amazon hence forth, u sell all used items.

"
"

  Awesome product in the price segment. It's very fast and easy to operate.Amazon team is also great as far as product delivery and costumer service is concerned.

"
"

  Been using it for a week.. Bought it during Prime Day Sale, delivery was as per schedule & installed by Samsung Team next day. Would have been a complete package it was Series 5 atleast & FHD IPS panel. Though this is DLED HD panel pic is enhanced by Pur Clour by Samsung otherwise it would have been washed out, but my previous 6yr old 22"" Samsung LED TV was FHD & IPS panel so I'm disappointed in that front..

"
"

  I am writing this review after 3 days use.1. Product Quality: Best quality in segment, not a cheep plastic and bad design. Remote is actually above quality feels premium in hand.2. Picture quality: Most significant part is actually very impressive. Bright and accurate Colors, good contrasts, ""Dynamic color mode"" is damn hot.3. Sound quality: Not like boom blast Dolby Atmos or DTS. But its come with Dolby Digital is not bad. High volume and not ruffled sounds at all. ""Amplifier Mode"" kind of movie theatre.4. Features: bluetooth is there, you can connect your phone, play any music directly opens in ""Tune"" in TV and thats very convenient. I haven't used screen mirroring. You can install other apps too.5. Performance: Its sometimes get lag while remote controlling to navigate, take a while for opening any App. But its not totally bad and full laggy performance like other cheep brand (CHINESE).I requested for installation and demo but service man still not here after 5 days too. I used on table top. (Taken Permission to open TV box from samsung).

"
"

   My tv show flow line in display, viewing angle very whitish, spoting display no similarity in all display, Please Replacement.

"
"

  No issues with the television but I had to shell out Rs 1800 for a flexy wall mount which I was told is a paid product and did agree to it. The one that comes free with the TV is fixed, and once mounted cannot be moved to different angles.  I requested for the flexy mount and was charged the price mentioned without a bill and was told a bill is not given for these services.That would be my only issue.

"
"

  Very good product for 15000 every thing works fineOrdered on july 15 received product on July 17 demo on July 18Good picture quality sound could have been better airplay works fine can connect all mobile only digital audio out no 3.5mm outputAlexa works fine but no google assistant will get it through software updateOverall good product go for it

"
"

  Duplicate pieces was sent. Which was confirmed by the Samsung and Amazon's technician it's motherboard got short circuit within 3 days after quick installation done by Amazon. Will not recommend. Thanks to Amazon for refunds but it took 3 weeks to complete the process.

"

  I received the TV at my place however I can not use it. It's been 9 Days, still no one arrived to install it. Samsung told me that if I install by my own Warranty will be void.I had 10 plus calls with Samsung still they promise me to send guy for installation but breaks it everytime. Even Amazon didn't help here.Pathetic Service! Dont by TV on Amazon if you dont want to get frustrated.

  The product is superb excellent comparing other same features brands ,personally my couple of friends had purchased other brands ,this performance is extra ordinary.screen mirror, connectivity ,picture clarity,smart features everything is superb and I am very satisfied with the performance of my product

"
"

  I am writing this review after after a month , overall my experience was good regarding this SAMSUNG TV it excellent picture quality and good Audio, but I was little disappointed with the performance of some apps ,and laggy interface and only some of apps are played smooth , however SAMSUNG can roll out some updates to fix this , and I see there is no Google assistant ☹️ ,tho its written on the box that there is Google assistant . Overall it was good 👍🏻.

"
"

  The resolution is cool and pretty as the T.V. is HD. Also, it has bixby and Alexa as the assistant. The T.V. contains HDMI ports, USB port and can be connected to wireless connection(WIFI) and antenna or cable connection. It has bluetooth connection too. This T.V. can be mounted on wall. The installation, if done by samsung company is free of cost but you require a lot of patience. The T.V. only takes 67.42 Kwh/year and if you unplug it from the main DC source, it can save more. I would conclude by my own experience that this T.V. is worth its cost and really up to the mark. Hope i covered all the questions.

  Picture quality is good. Sound quality is little disturbing,  it goes very low at times, and shoots up high. Need to maintain volume of 70+ for hearing movie dialogues, and for immediate background music u need to come back to the volume of 20+.  Short word- keep remote handy everytime.

"
"

  Probably best 32 inch smart tv with excellent picture quality , instant response bluetooth remote works flawlessly loved the live cast feature of samsung just experienced that it doesn't work if u are trying to cast from live streaming.Picture quality is brilliant samsung doesn't let down in that department.Prime video works smoothly.Voice assistance is good but can be improved via update.One of the best feature of this tv comes in the remote which is universal I don't have to use another remote for setup box.Will update my review after 1 month of use.

"
"

  Great tv at this price.Loved the features and the remote. Connectivity is awesome, tizen os is wonderful.

"
"

  i'm writing this review after a week using this product. i hv seen the picture quality and sound quality both r superb. i can tell u all that at this price this is the best quality smart tv im using right now..i'm pitty satisfied with the quality of this product and i'll recommend this tv to everyone who r luking under15k budget..i'll give 4star rating to this product...!!

"
"

  Poor sound quality and picture. Not recommended.no cable .

"
"

  Awesome tv at this price....Good picture quality.....Good features.....Good sound.....Good remote.....Fast boot.....Picture quality and index 900.....Voice search is very good.....Love it.....

"
"

  Amazing TV at 15k; features far exceed the price. Plus, with Samsung you are assured of a premium brand with its strong after sales service network. No need of Firestick, can watch amazon prime and Netflix at the flick of TV remote.

"
"

  Guys please dont get confused with smart tv on the subject please. I thought all smart tv are android based only but all samsung TVs work on tizen OS which doesnt provide external APK installation like JIO TV etc. So please be aware all MI TVs are android certified TVs so please prefer them rather than samsung TVs.

"
"

  I got tv in good condition but the installation service is really poor. Got the tv on 4th of july and called up 3 times still not done they are just giving false hope and last time when i called up they told that its been cancelled so they rescheduled it again....really so frustrating..😡..please Samsung improve your installation service

"
"

  Good vedio qualityBut got faulty product. Wifi not working, Called to the Samsung customer care but no propore response.Don't go with the product. Even Samsung wont bother once you buy the product.Waste of money.

"
"

  Best in price range got it for 13500 with citi bank  10% off.Tv was good with tizen Os gives around 4gb of space for apps.Voice commands is best supports Alexa ,bizbyComing to delivery took almost 15 days ,delivered by Delhivery ,they literally thrown tv upside down on road.I never trust Delhivery they dont care about products they are  Delivering.

"
"

  Best screen quality experience with the super smart and fast working remote but issues in voice recognition assistant and doesnt have Google assistant Bixby and Amazon Alexa is available as Bixby is useful Amazon Alexa is just waste if you dont have amazon smart speaker at home although a super experience with high quality feel no difference between the 4k  23000 rs and samsung hd ready both are same but if you have samsung phone or apple device it is the best smart tv you can buy for your smart home

"
"

  Received the product on 5th July 2020 and installation happen on 7th July.First impression review - Quality of picture is pretty good. Sound output is sufficient as per the size of TV. Features are yet to be explored. Overall product is well positioned to capture the market with competitive pricing. Worth buying!!!

"
"

  The best part of TV is its sound quality, picture quality is also good, easy to switch between TV and OTT, smart features are work smoothly, voice recognition is fair, what I don't like is I have to made Samsung account to run apps. Otherwise best in this range, and one more thing design of remote is impressive.

"
"

  Product is above & beyond in it's category with few cons like Bixby didn't recognizes the sentence/word & results in wrong search.. Picture & Sound quality is also not bad as per this price. So it's a best buy for budget-minded customers.

"
"

  Picture and sound quality is good but tv suddenly stopped working after 3 weeeks.

"
"

  I have bought a Samsung 32inches wondertainment series smart TV from Amazon. It was a suprb purchase and delivery was good. I got the product in 2days time. I have also felt the service from samsung was also good and they are really supportive helped to clarify all the doubts since I am using the smart TV for the first time.Picture quality and sound quality and recognition is good for the price of the product.100% satisfied and will continue shopping..

"
"

  The tv was fixed, it had smart features, picture quality, and voice recognition too is good. However, it does require internet connection and can't work only on Wi-Fi, so far I'm using WiFi, which is not stable as it goes off if wifi is not strong. Also other channels will need a dth connection.

"
"

   I am totally satisfied with the product...sound output is sufficient, display is good, bluetooth technology works perfectly..one can connect this samsung tv with any bluetooth device like spekaers/mobile/headphones...Offline mirror screening performance is really great.. i loved this samsung tv...thankyou amazon and thankyou samsung

"
"

  It's two months now since I purchased this TV. The delivery of Amazon was super fast.Pros:1. Budget-friendly2. Loaded with every smart feature3. Voice remote4. 20-watt speaker better than its predecessor5. Consumes less internet while running apps.Con:1. Screen casting lags sometimes may be due to a slow internet connection.2. Samsung store has fewer appsOverall best smart tv in this range.

"
"

  It's an absolute value for money. Delivered in 2 days and installed by samsung on the same day.Tizen UI is fluidic. You get 4 GB of ROM.Sound quality is exceeding expectations at this price point and is in par with tv at 30 to 40k price range.There is no doubt or question regarding the picture quality with samsung pioneering this department.Over all the product is an absolute value for money.

"
"

  Screen - GoodApps - Most OTT platform apps are available. Its based on Tizen OS so there are some limitationsPorts I/O - Useful amount of portsAudio - GoodGood is rated based on the fact that it is a budget product and should not be compared with premium products

"
"

  Samsung released V Good Tv 32 Inches Value for money and best display and best sound Good Smart Tv

"
"

   Product has issue with playing applications other than built in once, please don’t waste your money if you want to stream applications other than prime, YouTube and Netflix.This model has an issue and I had hard time with Samsung service guys and Amazon as well , i returned this TV.Attached video that shows repeating video and streaming issue.

"
"

  Good product but when installed i came to know that bluetooth feature is not there...i mean nowadays it is so common in smart devices ..but ok i compromised on it but major problem is that without voice control remote it is too difficult to handle youtube internet prime video etc....so i m telling you if you r buying tht tv plz go for voice enabled remote with tht tv ...except this performance is good

"
"

  Our TV which we purchased is not working now. We bought it only 2 months  before. We also tried contacting the customer care but there is no response till now.

"
"

  Voice recognition not available. Very few app application due to trizen os. Whatsapp,  Google meet, Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Explorer nothing works.

"
"

  When it was working, the product was great. We bought the TV in the first week of August, and within a few days, the TV basically went kaput. We got the company technician to check the TV, and he said there's some problem with a part in the TV. We returned it and got the refund. Didn't expect such poor make from Samsung.

"
"

  Bought this 20 days ago.Samsung has definately reduced the quality of this TV. We can see black line on screen quiet often. Very light weight and easy to carry.So far so good lets see hows it works .

"
"

  At this price point the balance of features and picture quality is just great. The TV was timely delivered and was mounted on the very same day of delivery. Thanks to seller/Amazon for prompt service requests post delivery.

"
"

  Worst ever experience!!! Amazon took 3 weeks to deliver product. Now 5 days past, product is yet to be installed. I'm now thinking why I did a mistake buying a Samsung product.  I should have bought from Reliance Digital or LG product. Done with Samsung.

"
"

  As per the price at which this Smart TV is offered it is definitely a good deal.The picture quality is good and the sound is amazing for a normal size room, you don’t have to use any external speaker.Most of the commonly used applications are available like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Zee5, Hotstar, Apple TV etc.The connectivity and other features are good too.

"
"

  features are very good, People looking for a good Smart TV in this budget just go for it.it will satisfy your expectations more compare to other.

"
"

  3rd class service of amazon as well as samsung. Its been a month now. I bought this tv and its not working properly. There is no voice at all. Company person came and repaired it 3 times and same isaue next day. This is definitely a manufacturing defect and now they are refusing to change the tv. Very very very very very poor service of amazon and Samsung

"
"

  You are not allowed to download any apps.you get only prime netflix zee5 and YouTube as built in applications,not all the promised applications were given.picture quality is worse.audio quality is great.i am facing issues casting my laptop to TV,which worked fine on the 1st day.the very main purpose pf buying this TV,casting,is not served.

"
"

  I AM ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED WITH THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT PROVIDED BY SAMSUNG. 16 DAYS AFTER PURCHASE OF THE PRODUCT AND ITS STILL NOT INSTALLED. SUPPORT IS NON EXISTENT AND TOTALLY UN RESPONSIVE. BUT STILL WARRANTY STARTS FROM PURCHASE DATE

"
"

  Smart features like wiseNetflix, prime video, zee5 and youtube , not working directly with TV remote.Picture quality and on HD is super fine but voice quality in HD mode is not clear, as feel voice is echoing.Voice Recognition function is not working.

"
"

  Nice Smart TV. Everything is good except absence of direct connection for Sound system. Sound system only be connected via Bluetooth. Am able to cast mobile screen also. So I like this TV very much.

"
"

  Crappy product, refused to switch on during the 2nd day of usgae.Avoid this particular model at all costs. Not sure if Samsung is using a crappy transformer or low cost power circuitry.

"
"

  Most affordable smart TV by Samsung.Netflix, Prime, Zee5, YouTube and morePaid only 14,000/-

"
"

  With this budget smart features is excellent, have not tried voice recognition and picture quality is meets the HD standard, overall it will definitely meets your expectations.It's always Happy to shop with Amazon 😎👍

"
"

  They could not install TV on time, so had to return it after 10

"
"

  Not fulfilled the expectation..The picture quality is satisfactory,not good.The voice recognition was poor...USB doesn't support multiformat.The UI is not smooth as it is in other samsung tv.If you can spend another ₹1000 better go for sony 32 inch HD non smart tv and buy tv stick separately..Its way better than others..

"
"

  I bought this for Rs 12849 (T4340)*Picture Quality is fine*Audio Quality is also good*Slim and looks stylish*Colour Quality is also well*SD channels are also give HD feelingInstallation was free of cost, but it took about 3 days after delivery due to holidays

"
"

  Happy on this TV. Smart features good. Picture quality and audio system excellent than expected. Alexa voice recognition good. Most satisfied.

"
"

  Overall the TV is good and you get a brand satisfaction of samsung which most people looks for... Picture quality is nice, i wont say excellent but its satisfying... Voice recognition feature can be better with 1 or 2 updates.... Otherwise you can totally buy it and you won't regret....

"
"

  Good picture quality...  Prime , Netflix , YouTube and zee5 is preinstalled , sound could be better , still better than many TV's in this price range .

"
"

  Its the best product in this price range with a lots of useful features.Best part is the screen mirroring and the Sound quality of this television. I am very satisfied with this product.Thanks Samsung and thanks Amazon for a great product of my need.

"
"

  Bad experience from Samsung installation... No one came until now... No wall stand given to me.... Don't know how to avail Netflix 6 month's subscription offer... Very bad experience from Samsung installation......

"
"

  I didn't like the brand because of their delay in installation support.. not even a single call was received from the samsung team.. do recheck before buying.

"
"

  Picture quality and sound quality is very good.Samsung service engineer not given the visit to my place for installation.  I remind them several times.

"
"

  Sound not working and product items already open who did this I got second hand product battery also put in remote

"
"

  CONS: Sound quality is not clear, that to if the fan is running can't hear the voices clearly. Same problem with my 2 year old samsung 43 inch Series 5 ""43M5570"" model TV as well. Kindly improve on the same.Pros: Picture quality is too good, smart features works well.

"
"

  I got faulty product and it HDMI port is not working. I am not getting any response from neither Samsung nor Amazon. It was one of the biggest mistake to choose Samsung over various other brand

"
"

  Awesome TV in this range.Picture quality, sound quality both are good. If u looking to purchase TV in this range, go for it. Best from Samsung. Delivery was also before time and installation on the very next day.

"
"

  I have received tv yesterday and got installation done today. Service by Samsung guy is awesome. I am really enjoying all the features of tv. This is awesome product. Sounds and picture quality is awesome. In this price range ifyou are getting samsung in this price range trust me this is really worth. Value for money.

"
"

  -Excellent picture quality-Excellent sound-Excellent looks-Quality product

"
"

  Obviously a brand product fullfilled all purpose without compromise with the quality.It's a great Smart tv by Samsung with good price.

"
"

  TV received is damaged, motherboard issue as per the engineer, please replace it.

"
"

  Smart buy for smart price, but obe thing need to highlight hear, i was eligible for ICICI Bank debit card EMI offer which was flat Rs.1499 off on EMI, but i didn't get this offer as the payment was getting decline again and again. Hence miss the offer.

"
"

  Very poor response from Amazon..got a defective product..asked for replacement of  the product on 5th August..till now Thier technician has not visited for inspection..

"
"

  BEST TV I HAVE SEEN A GOOD PRODUCT BY SAMSUNG BUT I WILL TELL YOU TO USE BIXBY VOICE ASSISTANT AS IT IS BETTER THAN AMAZON ALEXA

"
"

  1 Remote mic is not working properly2 No google assistant3 Installation and delivery is Good

"
"

  The TV is awesome. Smart features & picture quality is super cool. Sound output is little low. You need to attach Bluetooth speakers to get better sound output.

"
"

  I have recived this TV on 9th August and report to Samsung for installation on 10th August but .  Samsung is not complete installation in 6 days.  Samsung service is very bad

"
"

  This was my first Samsung brand purchase. Below are my reviews after using it for 2 months.1. Sound - Best in the business2. Picture - Perfect3. Bluetooth - Decent4. Tizen Store - Supports almost all apps like Playstore5. Voice Assistant - Loving Bixby

"
"

  Sound and picture quality amazing. But voice search not working. Demo person had no knowledge about tv and features. Very irritating. Service worst.

"
"

  I bought this product on Amazon sale.  And it's worth price. Saler wrongly mentioned that it has bluetooth. Other than every information is correct.Nice product, awesome sournd quality and most of the apps are available .

"
"

  Good quality picture, sound. Samsung rep installed TV very next day of delivery by Amazon. Very good service.

"
"

  Good quality TV, excellent picture quality, remote control is also controlled by voice, sound quality is also good, You can't install other apps of your choice like hotstar, it's a drawback. Apps choice is limited,

"
"

  Good product in this budget range. quality and sound ok. We got free installation by Samsung after delivery.

"
"

  The television is good with all the necessary features ....the voice enabled remote is good ...the picture quality is also very nice ....it's good value for money

"
"

  In this price I can buy mi 50 inch Android tv, but I didn't buy it.Samsung plz establish your companies in India and sell everywhere.Make In India....

"
"

  Low weight , high in tech ,superb outlook but sound quality is little less , picture quality is good under price range .

"
"

  Overall it's a good tv and deliver in a seal package, and good for a small room. while quality I doubt that samsung has  focus on it as the tv which I received has a faulty remote control but samsung service center replaced as if now. hope all good as if now.

"
"

  It is overall a very good smart Tv at this price point but it doesn't have bluetooth or voice assistant.....sound quality is decent...Picture quality is awesome....samsung is one of the best tv company so just go for it... you'll never be disappointed.

"
"

  Extra app can't download, except pre-installed appSmart features not available, you can't install extra app except pre-installed app, i am unabe to download Jio TV app

"
"

  As expected. Very good tv. Got it at 13.5k.smart features are very easy to operate

"
"

  very good product my order damaged but easily replacement♥️♥️♥️ an i think this support only 720p resolution but i see 1080p resolution. very good samsung products colours are very very good, i suggested for you this price is gpod product.  (Thanks Samsung's Team♥️)

"
"

  Its a best model one can go for without any second thought. Almost all smart features are boxed with one smart remote..voice assistants built in. Easy sharing with mobiles and many more..sound quality awesome with Dolby atmos output..no second thought to buy...5 stars...

"
"

  Samsung service is bad. I have called so many times for my installation. They will take all the dtails at snail pace and invariably the line will be disconnected.

"
"

  Picture quality and voice recognition is excellent. Prompt delivery with good care and no damages .  Highly satisfied .

"
"

  Voice recognition feature is not upto the mark and no wall mount kit provided in the box.

"
"

  Quality is superb nd sound is good. Installation done on same day of delivery. No comparison of Samsung brand with Chinese tv.

"
"

  Delivery was ahead of schedule & prompt installation by Samsung team. Due to the Onam festivity there is a special warranty of additional two years that Samsung extends for its products if company is installing. Request to share the approved warranty to the users.

"
"

  Good picture quality, easy to use remote functions, very clear sound quality. Good product at this price range and trust of Samsung. Also very prompt, efficient, safe and quick delivery from Amazon.

"
"

  This product is really incredible. This smart tv has high quality visuals and great sound quality. You can also use it as a desktop pc by just connecting cables. The connection through phone is easy. Overall this smart tv is easy to access. You would love it.

"
"

  Altough the tv is good but samsung do not coperate also amazon both cos i brought this telivision almost 10 days before still i didnt get any samsung intallation technician and i have complaint 8-10 times still i was given fake promises and i am dissatisfy

"
"

  TV working amazing and value for money. The only missing things that some apps such TVF play , MX players, Discovery and not supported althoug you can watch them viewing on TV through internet. Good product otherwise. Nice

"
"

"
"

  No comments just love it. OMG what a speed service by Amazon and samsung. I get the product delivered today 11am and installation done at 3pm within in 4hr. Super speed service. And forgot Android tv. This is best in class. Strongly recommend.

"
"

  Picture quality is Good and its  value for your money. On top of that you are buying a branded product.Smart TV in this range is a steal......Go for it.......

"
"

  Delivered on time, installations on same day. overall performance of TV also very good👍

  I purchased this Samsung 32 inch led tv after completing 15 days it suddenly turned off. After given service request, technician visited and said MOTHER BOARD issue. I really disappointed.

"
"

  Very good buy. Satisfied with the product. The sound quality is surprising. Battery is BAHUBALI. Overall very good.No need to hesitate to go for this. That's my personal opinion.

"
"

  PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY GOOD. LACKS AUTO AUDIO EQUALISIER AND ALSO LACKS BROADCASTING AND LIVE TELECAST. THEREFORE 4 STAR

"
"

  No installation Samsung Amazon company

"
"

  This smart TV is wonderful with all the smart options given.. voice assistants, good speakers, display etc.. except that microsoft is not supported.. watch out if you are planning to buy only for microsoft teams.

"
"

  It's totally fine.the picture quality is good.sound is also good ,the smart features are brilliant but voice recognition is just okay not so good.all about it is that reasonable price for such a great featured TV

"
"

  If u want to go trusted nonchina compny.. Samsung is always best... Nyc sound.. Easy installment... Nyc fuction.. Alll over 4.2 out of 5 ....if tv screen fully open with a little edge then it be more designalbe..

"
"

  Value for money. Best smart tv for this low budget.

"
"

  Got a cracked product and tried to reach out customer care but not able to get any proper resolution. Even I have the correct address the Tele executive said the address is not available at this time.

"
"

  smart features are very amazing easily accessible, best thing is play music on screen off , picture quality is too best ever, voice is very good at full volume it works as boofer , best smart tv ever

"
"

  Fantastic TVGo for it...Updating my review after 2 months,Tv functioning is still slow even after software update.Picture & Sound quality is awesome.Yet to get google assistant.

"
"

  Every thing is good but sound quality is not so good,have to adjust it for every channel or website

"
"

  Product and delivery is good.  But installation is too delay.Request to Amazon to take initiativeness for installation work. Means sent customer details to Samsung care then they will  contact customer.

"
"

  Received heavily damaged screen

"
"

  The sound is very good, Alexa works a little delayed and the picture quality is as per price..

"
"

  Don't buy this...Only one day working. Second day suddenly sound in tv. Tv is dead. No replace.....No body support...Cheeting seller...Duplicate product....Beware of this.......

"
"

  I am Happy with the product.Thank you Samsung.

"

  Its good with a good price.Some people told me i don't get it in this price. But the LED is best I have ever seen.Suggest others to buy. I am writing review after two months full usage .

"
"

  - Very average picture quality- Quite bad sound output. I have to connect my bluetooth speakers- Very cheap build qualityStill can't believe its a Samsung product!

"
"

  i really like the TV working good

"
"

  3.5 mm audio jack system not available. Not able to connect home theatre.Please don't but this product. Amazon is saying that product will not be returned

"
"

  Very clean is the TV box. Very poor delivery service is so dirty box, it will not be aware of the TV. If you come to install then it will be known what is in the recent of the TV

"
"

  I got very confused before buying this TV, but all doubt get clear after i started using it. Its sound is nice

"
"

  Received broken item, given request for return.

"
"

  All things are Gud in this tv . Can anyone tell how to use wireless headphones in this tv . This tv has bluetooth but unable to use

"
"

  It's a good tv..but don't expect much from it. The resolution is 720p and doesn't offer full satisfaction. I'm not satisfied with picture but the sound and voice recognition is good.

"
"

  With 12.5k after bank discount...its ok ok type...not too good and not to bad...considering boycott china product..alternate product was too go with samsung

"
"

  The best product in value for and this tv is no comparison in all tv company very good product thankyou for samsung , and Amazon is best delivery time and gud product best packaging

"
"

  Nothing to dislike except for that Smart voice which we believed will work like Alexa

"
"

"
"

"
"

  I bought samsung TV last month and within 10 days it got spoiled, poor quality, dont buy from AmazonAlso not getting any replies from samsung about it

"
"

  It was not good as I expected with Samsung however at least you should be giving be giving all the accessories which are coming with TV

"
"

  Excellent product fits the room. Worth the buy.

"
"

  We can use it as a projector using mobile or laptop.It may be used as music player.Sound quality and Voice recognition may be improve.Picture quality is average.

"
"

  The best in its category, if you are using samsung's latest phone then this is the TV you should be buying, my favorite features ,1.I can cast from anywhere directly to my TV, they have this YouTube livecast feature which needs to be configured first it takes 24 hours to get it verified from YouTube2.For those who saying Bluetooth is not enabled in this TV,  if you can't find it don't say its not , i have this Sony Bluetooth headphones ch700N its a complicated headphone with NFC which dont get easily connected with mobiles without NFC but with smart things app, i can choose the audio output to my bluetooth headphone and watch them seamlessly3. One universal remote which you can use  Alexa/ bixby ,make your DTH remote features copied directly into this remote,even control  audio devices connected to this TV, sleek and quality product3. For 14000 ( I got the sbi card discount) all these features + free installation of wall mount, the best TV with the best price.

  Good low price TV by Samsung. Installed same day by Samsung guy. Picture quality is good as it is hd ready. Sound quality average.

"
"

  Product design is good but the picture quality of full HD is very bad.MP4 not supporting

"
"

  Poor picture quality....waste of money...totally disappointment of the product....would like to replace the product...bad experience

"
"

  GOOD PICTURE CLARITY ,LIFE STYLE WATCH LED TV.  SOUND 14W AVERAGE SOUND BUT HOME THEATRE SYSTEM HELP BETTER GREAT SOUND. FAST SERVICE AMAZON & SAMSUNG.

"
"

  The picture quality is not so good , as company say this TV is full HD but quality of this like HD ready not full HD this picture is also not smart as mentioned on amazon... I am not setisfy with this product

"
"

  Only 2months of using TV, stopped working, got problem in mother board. Brand telling need to replace mother board, Picture quality is too bad. Need improvements in sound quality. And provide  delayed service from Samsung service team.I recommend DONT buy this product.

"
"

  Didn't expect such a quality product at reasonable price. Amazon made our day by providing what we exactly looking for. Super fast delivery and good response from Installation persons. Nowadays really stand is no where bothered and not using at all.. Persons who are looking only for quality HD view can go for it we brought it for our parents where they are looking only for quality dish views. And offcouse Pendrive options and access to ports are very easy since there are kept side ways. Thanks guys for understanding our requirements and making us feel that we made right  choice!!.. thanks Amazon and thanks Samsung

"
"

  TV's display is a big let down. The LED is very dimly lit and the colors are so inaccurate that it can't differentiate with grey & black, while and offwhite. I don't the how other products perform in this price range but this product definitely will not satisfy the quality you would expect from a TV.

"
"

  Bought it on Amazon Great Indian Festival at 30k with 1k cashback also..means 29k.Picture quality is superb..design is eligant...sound quality I felt not at par with contemprories like LG..can be improved.But still very good.Got Amazon fire stick with that 1k cashback applied..nd it cost Rs1900 only.So basically I got a full jd tv of 43inch at 29k nd changed it to smart tv in 2k only ..VALUE F9R MONEY.

"
"

  Kindly if you are planning for the purchase of TV.Follow these points:-1) Always check the ratio of Length and height which should lie in and around the ratio of 1.414.2) Do not get blind by seeing the larger inch in cheap price.3) Sony Bravia is always a better choice.

  The 14 watt sound output was way below expectations. Had to upgrade the output with the Boat Avante soundbar. The picture quality is also on the duller side but that should pass for a majority of users.

"
"

  I like this

"
"

  Wanted to replace it with better features TV as all the features weren't provided in the ad. Better spend some more and buy a better TV

"
"

  This is first time i am writing a review for product i purchased.. Picture quality is too bad.. I exchanged my 10 years old toshiba 32 inch LCD TV with this.. Now i regret.. Because that TV was far better than this Samsung HDTV. Speakers are also not as I expected..I wanted to return  this product but they refused.. So I have to suffer with this for next 1 year at least..😂 😂

"
"

  It was told that wall mount bracket is included but when I received the product wall mount bracket was not there

"
"

  Nice product picture quality better value for money

"
"

  When I bought this Television set, it was automatically rebooting/restarting after long hours of viewing. Recently it is rebooting after 5 min or 30 min. It falls back to start up screen.  I guess something is wrong or has gone wrong with the piece i bought. Now that return window has closed, I have to get it repaired or replaced at my own cost. We should be careful when we buy high value electronic goods online.

"
"

  This product got faulty within one month from the date of purchase,Unsatisfactory product,very disappointed ,locked complaints to samsung in last one month uneducated engineer comes for service within 3/4 alternate days but still not get the issue related to product.

"
"

  An excellent buy, and at this price point (29k without any deal/festive discount) cannot ask for more. Delivery was as scheduled and the Samsung engineer called the same evening and scheduled installation and demo. Great experience overall

"
"

  Sound is not clear.... More noise

"
"

  I got the Tv on time and Samsung contacted same day for installation.next day the service engineer came and installed tv on the wall And installation charges was zero.The picture quality is superb for HD category and there is no competence.The sound quality is not average but is ok for this price

"
"

  After 15 days use, slowly appeared lot scarches on display, Samsung support guy said not covered under warranty, he said display and service cost is 12,000/-, I purchased this tv at 12,500/-

"
"

  Picture and sound quality are average, as in same size samsung has costly models. But in this budget it is very good. Cost effective product.

"
"

  Amazing TV at this price from Samsung with 3 HDMI ports, solving my problem to have DTH, fire stick and my PS3 to be plugged in at the same time... great on time delivery by Amazon and then an installation by Samsung within 4 hrs of delivery..  great experience all across

"
"

  Poor picture quality.. and Amazon support team also not supporting for replacement or return (as per their return policy within 10 days terms) they are just making their customer fool. This is my last transaction with Amazon.

"
"

  it is an 2016 model

"
"

  Good service provided by samsung installation has done within 7 hours after delivery tv is also very cool considering price point

"
"

  1. Good quality and easy installation.2. Samsung engineer delivered the VISA (or something like that named) wall mount, the next day.3. Other features as usual.

"
"

  Good LED TV Overall. Excellent Picture & Sound quality. 20 Watts Extra Power Sound.Picture Quality . 720p video and 1080p video display in their own quality.  The colors are also very good and everything is shown in exact detail.  The sound quality is also very good crystal clear.  The highlight is Samsung's display.  So I really liked this LED tv

"
"

  Picture quality it is very poor. Sound quality is just comparable to mobile speaker only. May be we can consider the item for value for money, becoz i got the product for just 12200 rs. But, if u are a lover of hd movies and shows, never go for it. I strongly recommend sony only. This is my personal experience

"
"

  I brought this on 17th October few days back the tv was turn off automatically and then it on again 😡

"
"

  Picture quality is not good at all.Rgb setting is quite odd.I would suggest to go for a better one.

"
"

  If you are looking for basic LED having no extra features And you are not concerned over picture quality (this one is an average ) then this one is for you.

"
"

  I bought it on Prime Day Sale and got a really good discount. The delivery and installation process was smooth and commendable.Great deal.

"
"

  Ok

"
"

  Just received the TV , so far so good. Hooked in my PS4 and gaming quality was fine too, TV felt a little bit small but then again I have 55in TV so yeah I don't know how big 32in feels like. Otherwise it's awesome.

"
"

  Suddenly Sound not working while watching the tv, after switch off and on then also not working and not finding proper technical support also

"
"

  I was preferring to go offline, but thought to give a try with Amazon(first order for TV online). Guess what, I received my order as per expectations set on website. Even though you are unable to use internet/YouTube etc, this product is decent and good value for money

"
"

  On time delivery.Free quick and good installation service by Samsung customer Support.Great support from Amazon support team for arranging quick installation.Worth for money. Picture quality is good with HD channels.Overall satisfied with the product. :) .Use HD set up box for better picture quality.

"
"

  Very good experience with delivery and installation.. Got the product at a good price with additional discount through bank offers.. Bought it for my parents who needed a basic tv.. picture and sound quality is great..they are happy, no complaints

"
"

  As per committed 48hrs tv is not getting install , sasmung service center just they will tell service engineer will reach and also no one will reach for install even after 72 hrs .As their committed is not happening .Even service engineer also cutting phone he also not respond anything.

"
"

  Tv stand not came

"
"

  Mi tv is way better its not a smart tvPicture quality is not that good so buy mi tv 43""

"
"

  Pic quality is so so.  Pls improve the same.  MI is going ahead

"
"

  Value for money. Nothing extravagant. Picture quality is decent even for a non-HD connection, so is the sound.

"
"

  Worst product not even think to buy this. Horrible mistake made by me to buy this product from Amazon. Sound is unimaginable poor. Amazon is fooling its customers and also no body from Amazon to help.

"
"

  It is  not worth paid amount with out leg for the TV..

"
"

  Picture quality is very good 9/10.Sound is good 7/10.Overall its a very good product.

"
"

  The value of money is zero here.Amazon company didn't satisfying the costumer request. I want to return this product but they r telling Amazon policy.If I don't like and satiied with product then I can return it na? But the refuse everything.nither replacement nor return.

"
"

  Clarity is less when compared to my 32"" sony Bravia... Sound also not upto mark... On comparision...but good product

"
"

  led is really vry good... I gave review after use around one year... Quality is also good... There is no problem with it.. Must buy

"
"

  Good Product. Nice picture quality & sound quality. Easy to install. I'm not face any type problen after Installation. USB port- 1, HDMI port- 2, AV port-1, Analog cable port-1, Audio Output ""3mm jack""- 1.

"
"

  I booked smart TV ..but I have been received basic model....in this series 5  model.. updated features are not available ......

"
"

  Picture quality isn’t good as sony. Something is wrong with picture contrast how many times you try set a good contrast it doesn’t change a bit.

"
"

  Very long installation time no response at all from Samsung

"
"

  I have already told about the amazon customer care my room mate order by mistake kindly exchange the product to smart tv, but they didn't, and the quality is more poor of this tv also but they didn't

"
"

  Tv has been working well so far. No complaints. The Samsung techs came for set up. Very happy

"
"

  Within a year I am seeing black spots in the TV, I would say the quality is bad. Let me see what amazon has to say on this

"
"

  After all Samsung product and rationality priced. Good picture and sound.

"
"

  Awesome HD quality as samsung is leader in screens manufacturing nd amazon delivery price service everything awesome.thnks amazon

"
"

  i think it will spoil the name of samsung. we expect good picture quality. but i am not satisfied with even HD mode also. samsung  pls don't send this type low quality product to market

"
"

  Awesome as usual... samsung in its class.. i got this Rs 13500.. just bold deal..

"
"

  The Samsung product didn't let me down.Great quality and appreciable installation time taken by Samsung for the same.

"
"

  Picture quality not good sound is very poor if compromise who wants just a big tv they can go for it . Most of the popular video formats this tv doesn’t support only mp4 it supports

"
"

  Picture is flickering on day fifth of delivery.

"
"

  Get the watch distance right and augment sound with external speakers. It's good value for money.

"
"

  Not stesfyi

"
"

  Very good picture quality,sound is OK,definitely good choice

"
"

  Second hand TV

"
"

  Only samsung installation support was pathetic

"
"

  Good to have this product really its costed too cheap and got this with extended warranty thank you for this product

"
"

  The picture quality, sound quality are good. I would recommend this product for sure to others. So far so good. The product features can be improved with additional features.

"
"

  its pixel resolution was very low .. and not supporting over 1080 pixel

"
"

  Great tv. Follow up for Installation Was prompt.

"
"

  need to have hd box with hd channel packs.also hdmi cabel can make picture quality good

"
"

"

  Sound quality not so good. But its an amazing tv at this price point.

"
"

  Great price, excellent performance, delivered intact and installed within stipulated time

"
"

  Very nice

"
"

  The Samsung name itself is the reason to own it

"
"

  A good TV to buy in this price.Picture quality is good but not great, but sound quality is above normal expectations. One should buy this one for getting value for money.Service of Samsung is excellent.

"
"

  Nice... value for money.. Samsung always ultimate... ( t.v fixing  problem purchas corner stand but Samsung person not fixing I really upset... plz Amazon request fix stand..)

"
"

  Wall mount not received in Package.

"
"

  This TV picture clarify wise awesome.... only thing is sound is very low,you have to put additional speakers

"
"

  Picture quality is depends upon cable connection .Small draw back is sound in TV sound is low

"
"

  better Sound quality expected

"
"

  Excellent product from Samsung... Quality also very good. Loved it.

"
"

  Needs improvement in sound system. It doesn't enhance along with sound of TV service provider

"
"

  This Product  very  Good

"
"

  Excellent Product always and Main Difference with Old Version Sound System improvement Extraordinary and even 10% Volume is Enough 30*10 Hall

"
"

  Picture quality is very poor , Worst product from Samsung .tried to return it, Amazon is not accepting it. Worst service from amazon too.

"
"

  Power cable and audio/video jake cord not available in the box.

"
"

  It is marketed as a SmArt TV and it is not. Stand didn’t arrive with it. If you just want the TV, you can get it.It doesn’t connect to the Mobile phone either. Pretty ancient.

  T.V. is nice but Samsung guys who came to install TV charged 200 rs from me. And said you can complain to company they won't do anything. I don't think Amazon cares about it.

  For 32 inch advance smart,Pros1. Sound Quality is awesome (20 W speaker)2. Connectivity is good3. Budget product4. User interface is good5. Clarity is good for non source videos.Cons:1. instead of alexa , bixby voice control activated. Not upto the mark.2. Cant able to change the aspect ratio 4:3 to 16:9 or vice versa. it is constant depending on the service provider it has changed. 3. only optical connector for surrounding system not normal audio jack pin.Overall4.25 for 5

"
"

  Like1) picture quality superb..sd channel looks like hd... No issue.2) i love smart mirror option ....smooth connection with mobile.3)sound quality is good.I think in dis price range its a good choice........Luv  u samsung......

"
"

  TV continuously blinks for every 5 min.Service engineers stats that the issue with with set top box.I was using the same set top box for my previous LED TV aswell but never faced such issue.Looks like there is a issue / defect with the TV when connecting SD set top boxIts very sad that Service engineers are not accepting the defect in TV.i am going to buy a new HD Set top box and check.But its very sad that no where its written that this TV works only with HD connections.

"
"

  Product is good but the service engineer Mr. Santosh Prasad was so rude with lack of knowledge. He hanged the TV but not tell how to operate. Stated that u can read the mannual this is not my job. Im unsatisfied with sansung service. I give 0 star for services provided by samsung.

"
"

  I am facing issue with this TV, it get automatically switch off and comes on after couple of secs. This is happening frequently now. I would suggest, please don't purchase this TV until SAMSUNG confirms that they resolved the issue.

"
"

  This is just a LED Tv with smart option!!! The picture quality is worst I would say... yes the sound output is good... if you see a character with strip shirt or something like that the picture image would be shaky...that would hurt your eyes , I had to sell it with 1 day at a loss of 2 thousand... as amazon does not hv a return policy... please read return terms and conditions before purchasing...if ur looking a low budget tv with smart options please go ahead....

"
"

  After lots of research I found this as a best one, as it is HD ready, u see pixelated when u r too close. All the apps are working fine without any lag. Even 480p quality  YouTube videos look good. It can play high quality videos too. If you are using govt cable tv setup box, make sure your cable connections is good. And don't use AV cable to connect ur setup box with tv, Highly recommend to use HDMI cable to get good audio and video quality as I seen the difference as well I've posted it. I was using tizum and terabyte cable. The later is 144 rupees only. Bluetooth remote is also extremely useful. U can use urs mobile app also to share and control your TV.

"
"

  No blutooth connectivity as claimed in product description. Video quality is also poor.

"
"

  Tv picture quality is as expected, I received a TV with speakers which lasted for 2 hours, post which it stopped working, raised a ticket Samsung dealer closed the ticket stating called no response... that a lie .... later 7 days passed one Good engineer came respectful man... mentioned to replace mother board .... after 7 days we get to know pasts are not in stock,  we will refund your amount post deprecation... this is cause a loss to the customer time waste and unwanted stress... and all is blamed on lockdown :-) now the TV is out of stock looks like a Failer model for Samsung. Now the real pain begins Samsung is ready to refund the invoice amount in the form of a Samsung Cupon and we can only buy Samsung products from Samsung plaza... and no stock of 32 inches ... service team is calling and adding pressure stating we need the TV back... and no replacement... cash back ..no stock in samsung plaza....customers money ... but a hard and fast rule only to buy samsung this is like fooling on daylight.... highly disappointed... never again Samsung !

"
"

  The 32 inch Samsung Smart TV is a complete failure. It became mute on the second day and I have been waiting for a week for Amazon to replace or refund. They initially schedulded a technician visit for Aug 13, but postponed it to 17th while the return window closes on 19th. There is no place to contact, no mail or phone other than the call center or web site and there are no messages to confirm receipt of the customer complaint. You are not even publishing my genuine review and grievances for public benefit. I feel cheated.

"
"

  Got defective product. Display is not working after installation.Tried to called Amazon support and samsung support. But they are not taking responsibility to replace or return the item.

"
"

  Many features are missing. Tried to return. They said that it can't be returned if it wud have any demages then only it is possible.. not happy with the product

"
"

  Big mistake by buying from amazon after arrival on 16th day TV stopped working when we called Samsung their engineer visited and informed faulty piece and when we asked Samsung to replace they asked us to contact from whom we bought tv tats amazon when we contacted amazon they denying to help any furtherNever buy electronics from AMAZON

"
"

   This is my third LED TV and it is one of the best in this price. As compare to price features are comparatively very good. Below are some like and dislikes about itPros:- High quality pictures and video- Seamless video streaming from Netflix Amazon Hotstar YouTube and many more...- Its music player is customisable and its inbuilt Amplifier options is super.- Loud sound, till now playing with volume max to 50, i don't dare for 100 as neighbour will kick me out ;)- 4Gb of storage space allows lots of application installation.- TV has 2 HDMI ports & 1 USB ports.- Connectivity options included are HDMI , WIFI.- You can connect various gadgets such as your laptop using the HDMI port and Bluetooth.- you can access your cloud and can bring your work on big screen- Alexa and Bixby is inbuilt voice search options- interface is very user friendly, with in few hours you will get to know your TV- Customer service is excellent, installation done with in 3 hr of delivery. He checked it thoroughly before installing and provide full demo- Cloud option for gaming is one of the best featureCons:- Limited number of apps- Most of my favourite apps i can't install like Amazon Music (as per few websites it will be available soon), no app where we can get all tv content either paid or unpaid- If you are fan of cable content then definitely you need satellite TV connection , no other options- i am facing issue with screen sharing, it is not detected by my phone once i am disconnect from screen sharing. Other TV in my neighborhood are visible for screen sharing. When i reboot it then only i am able to connect.

"
"

  Though there are many other TV with more options and less price, i preferred to chose Samsung as its a standard brand but this product is not satisfactoryCons:1. Sound system isn’t that good you have to keep reducing the volume as BGMs sounds more than the actual speach2. Doesn’t fit for all types of home theatre3. No playstore (I might missed to see this before buying it)

"
"

  Picture quality is good and sound is great but it has some bluetooth connectivity problem with my bluetooth speakers (F&D) sometimes it's not able to transfer the audio and we need to delete and repair the speaker again & again.Casting is good but only with the Samsung mobile I have one Mi Note 5 and it's not able to pair with that one.Auto Backup Features is good but sometimes it's not run automatically and we need to start it manually to copy the data and sometimes it copies the same data for multiple times and create multiple copies of the same file in the USB.Only two Voice assistants are there BIXBY & ALEXA and both are only working when you are connected with the Internet while in Other Android TV the Google Assistant works offline too.Overall the TV is good in this Price range.

"
"

  The best TV under 15000 Rupees.1.It has brilliant sound output2 Installation is very easy3.User interface is good but don't expect super fluid interface like Android,at this price it is great.4.Great picture quality but connect proper HD dish connection for superb picture quality.5.Great build quality with good finishing of colour,I opted for grey colour,it is looking pemuim.6.Provided remote is simple and has useful featured buttons.""Overall this is the best TV under Rs.15000"".A big thanks to Samsung for such awesome budget TV""...The only thing I didn't like is packaging,hope Amazon should take proper care on packaging....

"
"

  Very Good LED TV in this price range. This is my first ever review on Amazon. Please don't buy TV like MI, Motorola, VU etc which are purely chinese made. A TV should be like a TV which purely performs in picture and sound segment and on DTH as well. This TV outperforms all its equivalent TV. Blindly go for it. Boots up within seconds. SD channel looks like HD channels. Mirroring is super fine. Be rest assured you won't require an external speaker. Even at 50 % sound is like home theatre. One year additional warranty by Samsung. It will definetly thwart Chinese brands out of market.

"
"

  DON'T BUY SAMSUNG TV. DON'T USE AMAZON FOR ONLINE SHOPPING!!!!Here is my whole experience or rather the nightmare.I bought the TV, It has brightness issues. The TV screen is dull even at max brightness. I reported the same to AMAZON. They arranged a tech visit for 4th Aug which never happened, wasted whole day for that visit. They rearranged it for 6th, the tech came and saw the issue they agreed, restarted updated the TV, still the issue was there. I enquired do they agree that issue is there they said Yes. Same evening I called customer support and got the Info that in their system the issue has been updated by the tech firm as resolved. I was dejected and felt cheated. After many hours of calls I was able to get my call transferred to the managers but both the times AMAZON disconnected my call. They kept on sending me messages for feedback. In their system the first visit resolved the issue. One of the customer care executives told me I was supposed to get the report in written from the tech which they did not gave me and did not tell me about. Don't buy this product and even if you want to buy from Flipkart. Samsung and Amazon has degraded their quality. Beware of tech company QDIGI they are the ones responsible for tech visits, read their reviews and you will know. And whats funny is Amzon is still letting them work.

  2020 best Tv. Nice purchase. Good Quality and specification. Tizen store. Some applications not available.  But this is enough.I purchased this for Rs.14000.Best price and best company.Alexa working very well.Sound quality best as 20 W. Good and enough.Picture quality awesome. Clear and crispy.New model remote.

"
"

  Hi Amazon, Samsung TV is very good and excellent picture quality( HD Channels only)  as well as sound quality also. No Bluetooth optional available.  No 3.5 mm audio output jack available but availble optical Digital output audio.  TV Build quality also good. Finally I loved this new series Samsung Tv with voice search..  In Television section , Samsung and Sony companies are top. Samsung is always Samsung.. If any body wants to purchase please go, don't think and hesitate.Thank you Amazon and Samsung.

"
"

  At last I have to write the comment regarding my first bad experience of amazon and samsung I bought this tv last month only n its remote stopped working after 2 or 3 days I put the complain two times n the so called engineer also came both the time the complaim didn’t solved they didnt repaire my remote still status of complain they are putting is repairing completed how come they lie like this very irritating n the man the so called engineer who came to us first he is was telling that there is a problem with tv than i asked if u have any remote kindly check with it than he said no its problem with remote only i will order for u n let u know rubbish i didnt got any revert than he was repairing the remote by bitting it in the table it was very illiterate and bad behaviour towards a thing ehich is related with somebody

  Smart TV by Samsung.Most affordableNetflix, Prime, Zee5, YouTube,amazon primeTakes a bit of time to boot. But bluetooth is not supported. And sound quality , pictures quality everything is is goodPaid only 14,000/-

"
"

  Very good TV in this price. More interesting thing is this Works very well with Apple TV .

"
"

  I am writing this review after 2 week's of usage. I am not a very fond of cable which provides so many unwanted channels.Completely wonder entertainment if you are usingWiFi connection. Good to have preloaded Zee5, Netflix & YouTube what else you require. Prompt delivery and free installation makes you feel very happy by Samsung. only cos i found its 20watt speaker op. Yes but we have alternate solutions for this.

"
"

  The TV is faulty item. It  is an under quality product.  It produces buzzing sound and sound stops after every 1 hour or so. Seller has shipped a faulty item and it needs to be resolved by Amazon since TV was bought at amazon.com and not via SAMSUMG. Contacted the Customer support agents were not helpful at all and did not want to file a report against the  seller since they are shipping under quality product. After 20 mins of back and forth via phone call, The leadership team at amazon only filed some voice of customer form.  It is hard to wrap my head around the fact if amazon guys are shipping  an under quality product and  supporting those sellers and making customers run from pillar to post.. Why have the seller on your platform ? Does Amazon stand for harassing the customers and false advertisement ?  Why can't Amazon guys talk to seller and have the matter solved.. The agent was not even ready to report the seller. Kept on telling me to talk to Samsung. Executives at amazon's are not paying heed to anything just making money with fat bonuses for false advertisement and making customers unhappy for no fault of theirs

  No Samsung tape in Samsung tv box. So I have doubt for original tv received or not?

"
"

  Goods :1. Good Picture Quality2. 20 W Speaker output, good enough for a mid size room3. Fast installation - NOTE : Wall mount does not come in the box, it is brought by the installation engineer.4. easy to set up.5. For Samsung phone users, Smart View makes casting to screen very easy.Bads:1. You have to call Samsung for installation. does not happen by default. Reason for 1 less star.2. Prime App is very slow.3. Keeping a watch, it shut down twice on it's own.

"
"

  First of all it’s Made in Vietnam & not in China which was one of the main reasons I chose this one over any other TV.1. Box comes with TV, Remote, stand, power cable, 2 batteries & quick guide. March-2020 model with 2 star on energy efficiency ratings. The remote is sleek & curved and has an awesome feel While using.2. Installation happened the very second day post delivery. Executive who came was very professional. Even when they drill the wall they ensure your room remains dust free. Executive offers Samsung insurance extension for 1,2 & 3 years at a nominal price of around ₹1600 for a year. (I opted for AC ko third party with TV)3. Mind well this is Tizen OS And not Android. Make sure to update your TV OS once you get it.4. You can use screen mirroring on iPhone & android.5. Sound is the only option where TV can probably score a bit better6. You can install smart things app from Samsung and use your mobile as a remote.7. 30 days free trial of Netflix, Prime & Zee 5 is also included. Incase you have subscription already it does get extended.Overall an awesome TV to buy in this price range. It’s a excellent product & indeed has a very good value for money.

  Picture was ok and bought it for vfm. It was a good deal but the sound was defective. Requested replacement but replacement was not available. So product returned. Would be satisfied if the product was working. Delivery experience was good.

"
"

  I bought one Samsung 43"" in Feb and after good experience of 4 months I bought this one So no question on quality. Got installed in 4 hours of receiving it which was another good part of service. Inbuilt Alexa and got discount of 1750 so its a wonderful deal.

"
"

  Delivery is on time but the people who come for fitting are rude , Ill Mannered and have ZERO sense of timing“ this is how we work “ is what they say !

"
"

  As usual, product received on time, thanks to Amazon for the timely delivery. The box packaging was neat. I have installed this in my bedroom and it looks sweet. I purchased the Voice Control version. Let's talk about the pros and cons.Pros:1) Multiple voice recognition options as mentioned.2) Major OTT apps available but nor all. Apps like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Zee5, Apple TV+, Apple Music is pre-installed. Available apps on Samsung store are Disney+ Hotstar, Google Play Movies, Sony LIV, Voot. No Discovery+ yet. There are plenty of other apps, but I didn't find them useful.3) Decent picture quality at the price.4) Free TV wall mount, through Samsung Installation technician.5) Stylish remote, loved the way it is designed.6) Plays 1080p videos well in the 720p frame.7) Dual-band wifi. 2.4 and 5 GHz.Cons:1) Audio quality is average given the 20-watt speakers.2) Should have been a 1080p instead of 720p.3) Price slightly higher as compared to other competitors.This is based on a 2-day usage. Will update more as and when.

  I'm a simple middle class man, been using samsung appliances since more than 2 decades, this is my 1st tv, we had an old crt tv which was also of samsung, it was superb, and this is our new and first smart tv, we were tempted by vu and mi but apprehensive of chinese brands, so went for the safe choice, this has voice search which is really useful, installation happened on the same day of delivery. Tv Stand comes with tv but wall mount (also free) comes when samsung guy comes home to install. Tv looks good, works well, this is initial review, i will update you whenever i have something to say.

"
"

  The product was delivered before scheduled date and in good condition. And thanks for that. But tv wall mount kit for not in the box.Please let me know why it was not sent along with TV set.

"
"

  Bought it on aug 4, It stoped working after a week, till now they won’t respond properly and they were unable to repair or replace. Pathetic service by SamsungWorst product not even work for 10 days

"
"

   Every things matching with product description / details, Very nice picture quality with HDMI Cable but audio (sound) quality is poor but little bit of improve with auto / amplifier mode in settings otherwise can use bluetooth speaker / HDMI Arc audio tether system / external speaker with Settopbox (STB), and when use as personal computer wirelessly that time its delay or lagging, Over all it's value for money still still it's working and hope it will work for long time and A Suggestion - give some rest for 30 minutes or above if it's used for long time a day (on Dated 04-08-2020)

"
"

  The product that I received is a defective one.No sound coming from tv.PICTURE QUALITY  IS GOOD.smart features as expected are good.I ordered it on 19sep and it was delivered on 21sep and the technician came on 22sep and then we found that sound is not coming from TV.He tried all reset settings and factory reset settings but still the problem persisted.Then he suggested me 2 options.1) They(Samsung,) open the TV and will rectify the error2)To returnAs it is a brand new TV and I thought to return.I have put request for return and then Amazon customer care contacted me and he said that an Amazon technician would visit and he himself gives a report and then they will consider replacement.so he ordered inspection service and it was scheduled for 24sep but on 24th morning I received a message that inspection service order was canceled.Today ie on 24sep I have again put the same return request and again the Amazon customer care called me and I explained him everything.He said he once again put inspection order and it is scheduled again for 25sep.I hope he comes.It was a surprise for me.I have been purchasing online since many years but a product like TV,a defective one?Didn't expect this and I hope it will be rectified soonThe technician visited on 25th sep and again customer care person contacted me and he said TV will be replaced on 29th sep.He said the same person will bring a new TV and he takes back defected one.I got replacement on 29th and got fitted on 30th sep.For the price,Picture quality and sound quality are very good.smart features are good.The TV has adaptive display like we have in mobile.Satisfied with the product

  Picture, Sound and Connectivity of this model is awesome at this price. Delivery delayed by a week due to lockdown but amazon has robust communication mechanism and informed me about  shipment status. Wall mounted TV next day of delivery by Samsung Engineer and found very prompt response without extra charges.Must buy TV in this price and well ahead compared to Chinese TV in overall quality. One remote, Good voice recognition, Dolby music system, lag free performance and easy user interface are unique features of Samsung wondertainment tv. Afterall brand is brand and quality matters.

  Poor sound quality and picture. Not recommended.no cable .

"
"

  Absolutely horrible tv!!! PLEASE DO NOT BUY! Defective product was delivered. Blurry display with flickering lines on the screen at all times. Also, the refund process was a big headache as I had to constantly be in touch with Samsung as they weren't giving be a job sheet which was required by amazon to initiate a refund. Also, even after me telling Amazon and giving proof in form of videos did not initiate a refund and made a regular customer suffer!

"
"

  So I am writing this review after a month the the major points you should know about this  product are..Pro.1. Best display in this price range.2. Support all mazor application like YouTube, hotstar,Netflix, amazon prime,jiocinema..etc3.Non Chinese product.4.superb remote with voice assistant(Bixby,Alexa).5.fast os better than mid range android TV's.Cons1.jio tv application  is not supported2.sound quality is average

"
"

  good choice in this proce range getting samsung better than mi and those Chinese brands

"
"

  Pros-Good picture quality.-At 20W speaker sound is also good-Can be easily connected with Bluetooth devises.USB port working well. No format issue with pendrive.-No issue in wifi connection (even in connecting mobile hotspot)-Very good and quick installation service by SamsungCons-As it is not android TV you cannot download app like VLC media player which will help us to play video which is of different format.-Voice recognition needs improvement. (However in you tube app it works perfectly).

"
"

  This tv is very good at this price1 picture quality excellent2 smart connectivity also very good.3 sound is sufficient and clear.for 10/10 ft room 20% volume is is enough.

"
"

  Picture and sound quality is good but tv suddenly stopped working after 3 weeeks.

"
"

  TV stopped working within 7 days. Now these amazon ppl are happy for not assisting as the return policy has expired. Contacted Samsung, they say motherboard has a problem raise it with Amazon.Pathetic... Have been buying a lot of products from Amazon... NOT AGAIN

"
"

   After researching for 2 months I placed an order for this T.v.The voice quality is superb and the display colours are soothing and not irritating to eyes.Our WiFi router is placed a little far ...but still the videos run without buffering on high quality.If you are looking for a 32 inch smart tv undoubtedly you can go for this.The customer service is 24*7 and that's a relief as you know your query would be handled. For the other brands before buying I had tried contacting for a normal query buy they either weren't available or had no interest in ansering. But Samsung customer service par excellwnce.

"
"

  I was little apprehensive about the delivery, as ""Delhivery"" is quite infamous. But to my delight, it was delivered in perfect condition. The installation was quick too.Even if you are using an SD dish tv, it works well with no blur.Sound is good for a medium sized room, smart things app is pretty handy in case the remote is away and you are lazy :P.I absolutely love the tune station showcase mode.Cons :TV takes up like 2-3 mins to start up in the first few starts, but this doesn't happen later.voice recognition doesn't provide much of a use advantage.There is no data saver mode, but the tv is not consuming a lot of data so it is alright.Overall, this tv is absolutely worth it.

"
"

  Well, you won't get better TV in this price range.Picture clarity is as good as it gets with 720p screens. You will need to change couple of settings when it starts fresh but rest all is just fine.I have a Sony Bravia which is 1080p. And Sony is better in every segment as it comes with 1080p resolution plus bravia Engine but Samsung is very well designed and offers a good enough package when compared to Sony. Sound is great as well. Tizen OS is smooth and gives you great experience, the only problem here is, you don't get many apps. Choices are less. Amazon firestick offers more apps.I don't know why but Remote which comes with TV is not same for everyone. Possibly there are 2 types of remotes, 1 with that Circular button which has very less buttons. Where in which I got has too many buttons on it, this buttons are so small, it's a hassle to type with them. Believe me you will get irritated to use the remote in night when lights are off.You can control the tv somewhat with mobile app that samsung provides. It's pretty nice and the UI is well developed. But all you can do is change apps, close, volume control and tv on/off. You can't control inside of any app.Built quality is good. Parts are tough. Samsung will provide installation free of cost for wall mount.To conclude : You can go for it if you want smart TV. It's made in India/Vietnam.

"
"

  Product are good but Led TV wall hangings items i didn't find in the Box.

"
"

  I received the TV at my place however I can not use it. It's been 9 Days, still no one arrived to install it. Samsung told me that if I install by my own Warranty will be void.I had 10 plus calls with Samsung still they promise me to send guy for installation but breaks it everytime. Even Amazon didn't help here.Pathetic Service! Dont by TV on Amazon if you dont want to get frustrated.

"
"

   The first time I bought the tv, it was defective and there was a problem with the display. Amazon knowledged the problem and immediately refunded. When the tv came back in stock, I ordered again. Installation happened on the same day and picture quality is really good. Love the features for the price point.Personally, I feel its the best tv for the price point.

"
"

  Really loved it. Screen mirroring is awesome.I can watch you tube,prime,zee5 ,Netflix hotstar. I didn't check this with USB.Overall it's a good product bought it for 13999. But delivery period took 17 days  except this remaining everything is so good.

"
"

  Verry bad exp. With this purchasing i retrun that product back to amazon today After two days of instalation tv screen will blincking and of

"
"

  This is the amazing  HD TV with included all the smart features .. picture quality is awasome ..dolbi digital Plus music system is great ...also price is reliable at this sagement ...this is the perfect TV for latest brand new features with 2020 ... You can easily cannect Bluetooth , cast screen and WiFi ....I order this TV on Sunday and came at Wednesday a time to time perfect delivery by Amazon ..and I installed this TV by help of user manual by Samsung guide...also I request to Samsung installation executive..for instructions regarding this TV and his features ...Thank you Amazon ...

"
"

  such a perfect & durable quality is provided by samsung.....picture quality and its all smart feature is at its best.....onl;y one thing is wrong in its product description. there is no google assistance feature in this mode...they shows that 3 voice command assistance is there but actually that is wrong...only two is there...one is samsung own system and another one is alexa.....other wise other all information is matched with the actual product....and in this price this tv is worth to buy...

"
"

  A very good TV at this price, with the features it has.

"
"

  awesome tv... very good with connectivity it supports iPhone's screen mirror out of the box very satisfied if you are looking for 32inch smart tv just close your eye and buy this model don't have any other second thoughts. the remote of the tv can be used to control other devices connected

"
"

  Not expected from Samsung. TV stopped working within 20days. Top of that I raised a service ticket with samsung, no one contacted for weeks, technician visited after week, said he will replace motherboard and will inform once part is available. The next week ticket closed without informing me and closed saying its successfully repaired TV with all quality checks are passed.Do not trust Samsung products and service, very bad experience. I will think twice buying from Amazon, second-order cancelled without intimation.

"
"

   Quality product  ,Samsung installation service goo

"
"

  Using it from last 10 daysNice picture qualitySound is goodSupports many OTT apps such as YouTube, Netflix, Sony LIV, Hotstar, amazon Prime, voot, zee5, and many moreAlso support phone Casting, bluetooth and WiFi

"
"

  The best part of TV is its sound quality, picture quality is also good, easy to switch between TV and OTT, smart features are work smoothly, voice recognition is fair, what I don't like is I have to made Samsung account to run apps. Otherwise best in this range, and one more thing design of remote is impressive.

"
"

   Till the installation it was nice but when I opened Microsoft 365, on the white screen I saw something moving here and there. It is a cockroach moving here and there on the screen of my TV. The Technician from Samsung told me to have a replacement but amazon is not providing the replacement even  I called with-in four hours of the installation.

"
"

  I expected lot on the quality of the samsung but after using for a month there is a problem in display. A line zig zag is appearing on the screen. I request to replacement or repair at the earliest.

"
"

  Thanks very much to Samsung and Amazon too. Picture quality is really awesome if you watch in HD channels and picture quality is very good on SD channels also. Sound quality is also very good. I am really very happy to buy this product at very reasonable price . I suggest this is the best product if you looking to buy at this range.

"
"

  The most horrible tv and horrible customer service of Amazon, the tv's app store doesn't have a single video player to play movies from a pen drive, the bluetooth connectivity is name sake as the sound is distorted(i have tried 3 bluetooth devices), I cannot connect my sound bar as there is no option of coaxial cable in tv, also the tv speaker sound cracks on high volume, I want a different brand tv for the same price, turns out even that is not an option, I will never order anything from Amazon hence forth, u sell all used items.

"
"

  Awesome product in the price segment. It's very fast and easy to operate.Amazon team is also great as far as product delivery and costumer service is concerned.

"
"

  Been using it for a week.. Bought it during Prime Day Sale, delivery was as per schedule & installed by Samsung Team next day. Would have been a complete package it was Series 5 atleast & FHD IPS panel. Though this is DLED HD panel pic is enhanced by Pur Clour by Samsung otherwise it would have been washed out, but my previous 6yr old 22"" Samsung LED TV was FHD & IPS panel so I'm disappointed in that front..

"
"

  I am writing this review after 3 days use.1. Product Quality: Best quality in segment, not a cheep plastic and bad design. Remote is actually above quality feels premium in hand.2. Picture quality: Most significant part is actually very impressive. Bright and accurate Colors, good contrasts, ""Dynamic color mode"" is damn hot.3. Sound quality: Not like boom blast Dolby Atmos or DTS. But its come with Dolby Digital is not bad. High volume and not ruffled sounds at all. ""Amplifier Mode"" kind of movie theatre.4. Features: bluetooth is there, you can connect your phone, play any music directly opens in ""Tune"" in TV and thats very convenient. I haven't used screen mirroring. You can install other apps too.5. Performance: Its sometimes get lag while remote controlling to navigate, take a while for opening any App. But its not totally bad and full laggy performance like other cheep brand (CHINESE).I requested for installation and demo but service man still not here after 5 days too. I used on table top. (Taken Permission to open TV box from samsung).

"
"

   My tv show flow line in display, viewing angle very whitish, spoting display no similarity in all display, Please Replacement.

"
"

  No issues with the television but I had to shell out Rs 1800 for a flexy wall mount which I was told is a paid product and did agree to it. The one that comes free with the TV is fixed, and once mounted cannot be moved to different angles.  I requested for the flexy mount and was charged the price mentioned without a bill and was told a bill is not given for these services.That would be my only issue.

"
"

  Very good product for 15000 every thing works fineOrdered on july 15 received product on July 17 demo on July 18Good picture quality sound could have been better airplay works fine can connect all mobile only digital audio out no 3.5mm outputAlexa works fine but no google assistant will get it through software updateOverall good product go for it

"
"

  Our TV which we purchased is not working now. We bought it only 2 months  before. We also tried contacting the customer care but there is no response till now.

"
"

  Duplicate pieces was sent. Which was confirmed by the Samsung and Amazon's technician it's motherboard got short circuit within 3 days after quick installation done by Amazon. Will not recommend. Thanks to Amazon for refunds but it took 3 weeks to complete the process.

"
"

  Picture quality is quite good for the price range. Remote control unit quality is really good, it does not feel like plastic toy in the hand. Sound quality is quite clear and remains clear at high amliptude.User interface may seem complex at first but it's is only because they have given so many smart features at such a low price. Once you get used to it, you just admire the number of features you have with this tv at the price range.Voice recognition does not work well though, it can not recognise regional language titles easily.But overall quite a strong contender to buy.And moreover it is a brand Samsung, so it adds that value to your living room.

"
"

  The product is superb excellent comparing other same features brands ,personally my couple of friends had purchased other brands ,this performance is extra ordinary.screen mirror, connectivity ,picture clarity,smart features everything is superb and I am very satisfied with the performance of my product

"
"

  I bought this tv 2 months back...there is No chromecast, No google assistant built in as advertised. Also it is too light weight. Panels and plastics are too worse quality.The display is broken during just hand cleaning, it is made by that much light and poor quality. I called so many times samsung care and they did not waive off or gave any discount on display cost which is Rs. 8500. I am unable to use this tv within 2 months. There is no support from samsung being very new tv. Pls dont buy this tv.Babu from tirupur

"
"

  I am writing this review after after a month , overall my experience was good regarding this SAMSUNG TV it excellent picture quality and good Audio, but I was little disappointed with the performance of some apps ,and laggy interface and only some of apps are played smooth , however SAMSUNG can roll out some updates to fix this , and I see there is no Google assistant ☹️ ,tho its written on the box that there is Google assistant . Overall it was good 👍🏻.

"
"

  The resolution is cool and pretty as the T.V. is HD. Also, it has bixby and Alexa as the assistant. The T.V. contains HDMI ports, USB port and can be connected to wireless connection(WIFI) and antenna or cable connection. It has bluetooth connection too. This T.V. can be mounted on wall. The installation, if done by samsung company is free of cost but you require a lot of patience. The T.V. only takes 67.42 Kwh/year and if you unplug it from the main DC source, it can save more. I would conclude by my own experience that this T.V. is worth its cost and really up to the mark. Hope i covered all the questions.

"
"

  Picture quality is good. Sound quality is little disturbing,  it goes very low at times, and shoots up high. Need to maintain volume of 70+ for hearing movie dialogues, and for immediate background music u need to come back to the volume of 20+.  Short word- keep remote handy everytime.

"
"

  Probably best 32 inch smart tv with excellent picture quality , instant response bluetooth remote works flawlessly loved the live cast feature of samsung just experienced that it doesn't work if u are trying to cast from live streaming.Picture quality is brilliant samsung doesn't let down in that department.Prime video works smoothly.Voice assistance is good but can be improved via update.One of the best feature of this tv comes in the remote which is universal I don't have to use another remote for setup box.Will update my review after 1 month of use.

"
"

  Great tv at this price.Loved the features and the remote. Connectivity is awesome, tizen os is wonderful.

"
"

  i'm writing this review after a week using this product. i hv seen the picture quality and sound quality both r superb. i can tell u all that at this price this is the best quality smart tv im using right now..i'm pitty satisfied with the quality of this product and i'll recommend this tv to everyone who r luking under15k budget..i'll give 4star rating to this product...!!

"
"

  Awesome tv at this price....Good picture quality.....Good features.....Good sound.....Good remote.....Fast boot.....Picture quality and index 900.....Voice search is very good.....Love it.....

"
"

  Amazing TV at 15k; features far exceed the price. Plus, with Samsung you are assured of a premium brand with its strong after sales service network. No need of Firestick, can watch amazon prime and Netflix at the flick of TV remote.

"
"

  Guys please dont get confused with smart tv on the subject please. I thought all smart tv are android based only but all samsung TVs work on tizen OS which doesnt provide external APK installation like JIO TV etc. So please be aware all MI TVs are android certified TVs so please prefer them rather than samsung TVs.

"
"

  I got tv in good condition but the installation service is really poor. Got the tv on 4th of july and called up 3 times still not done they are just giving false hope and last time when i called up they told that its been cancelled so they rescheduled it again....really so frustrating..😡..please Samsung improve your installation service

"
"

  The best LED TV you can get at a cheaper price. Clarity & colour combination is excellent. Picture quality is awesomeIt supports all formats & it’s design is elegant. Voice operations are more accurate.Many modes of pictures r given.100% value for the money

"
"

  Good vedio qualityBut got faulty product. Wifi not working, Called to the Samsung customer care but no propore response.Don't go with the product. Even Samsung wont bother once you buy the product.Waste of money.

"
"

  Best in price range got it for 13500 with citi bank  10% off.Tv was good with tizen Os gives around 4gb of space for apps.Voice commands is best supports Alexa ,bizbyComing to delivery took almost 15 days ,delivered by Delhivery ,they literally thrown tv upside down on road.I never trust Delhivery they dont care about products they are  Delivering.

"
"

  Best screen quality experience with the super smart and fast working remote but issues in voice recognition assistant and doesnt have Google assistant Bixby and Amazon Alexa is available as Bixby is useful Amazon Alexa is just waste if you dont have amazon smart speaker at home although a super experience with high quality feel no difference between the 4k  23000 rs and samsung hd ready both are same but if you have samsung phone or apple device it is the best smart tv you can buy for your smart home

"
"

   tnx to AMAZON and SPECIALLY TNX TO SAMSUNG for this great package of value of money.Smart features are very nice . Easily connected to any device.Sound and picture quality are superb.Voice recognition are very useful tool for everyone.I installed it in  july 13 by the help of engineer providing by samsung thats man are very humble.My last two month experience are great with this Led.Below 15000 you can go without think to purchased it ..

"
"

  Received the product on 5th July 2020 and installation happen on 7th July.First impression review - Quality of picture is pretty good. Sound output is sufficient as per the size of TV. Features are yet to be explored. Overall product is well positioned to capture the market with competitive pricing. Worth buying!!!

"
"

  Product is above & beyond in it's category with few cons like Bixby didn't recognizes the sentence/word & results in wrong search.. Picture & Sound quality is also not bad as per this price. So it's a best buy for budget-minded customers.

"
"

  At the time of surfing on the Amazon Website it was no where mentioned that the Tv should be in a working condition. This option anyone can check under the head of exchange offer, no where it is mentioned that the Tv should be in a working condition. At the time of finalizing the booking and making the payment, these people just make a fool by Misguiding their customers.They just temp us of giving a hefty discounts. Be very very careful dealing with them.

"
"

  I have bought a Samsung 32inches wondertainment series smart TV from Amazon. It was a suprb purchase and delivery was good. I got the product in 2days time. I have also felt the service from samsung was also good and they are really supportive helped to clarify all the doubts since I am using the smart TV for the first time.Picture quality and sound quality and recognition is good for the price of the product.100% satisfied and will continue shopping..

"
"

  The tv was fixed, it had smart features, picture quality, and voice recognition too is good. However, it does require internet connection and can't work only on Wi-Fi, so far I'm using WiFi, which is not stable as it goes off if wifi is not strong. Also other channels will need a dth connection.

"
"

   I am totally satisfied with the product...sound output is sufficient, display is good, bluetooth technology works perfectly..one can connect this samsung tv with any bluetooth device like spekaers/mobile/headphones...Offline mirror screening performance is really great.. i loved this samsung tv...thankyou amazon and thankyou samsung

"
"

  It's two months now since I purchased this TV. The delivery of Amazon was super fast.Pros:1. Budget-friendly2. Loaded with every smart feature3. Voice remote4. 20-watt speaker better than its predecessor5. Consumes less internet while running apps.Con:1. Screen casting lags sometimes may be due to a slow internet connection.2. Samsung store has fewer appsOverall best smart tv in this range.

"
"

  It's an absolute value for money. Delivered in 2 days and installed by samsung on the same day.Tizen UI is fluidic. You get 4 GB of ROM.Sound quality is exceeding expectations at this price point and is in par with tv at 30 to 40k price range.There is no doubt or question regarding the picture quality with samsung pioneering this department.Over all the product is an absolute value for money.

"
"

  Screen - GoodApps - Most OTT platform apps are available. Its based on Tizen OS so there are some limitationsPorts I/O - Useful amount of portsAudio - GoodGood is rated based on the fact that it is a budget product and should not be compared with premium products

"
"

  Very poor response from Amazon..got a defective product..asked for replacement of  the product on 5th August..till now Thier technician has not visited for inspection..

"
"

  Samsung released V Good Tv 32 Inches Value for money and best display and best sound Good Smart Tv

"
"

   Product has issue with playing applications other than built in once, please don’t waste your money if you want to stream applications other than prime, YouTube and Netflix.This model has an issue and I had hard time with Samsung service guys and Amazon as well , i returned this TV.Attached video that shows repeating video and streaming issue.

"
"

  I have recived this TV on 9th August and report to Samsung for installation on 10th August but .  Samsung is not complete installation in 6 days.  Samsung service is very bad

"
"

  Good product but when installed i came to know that bluetooth feature is not there...i mean nowadays it is so common in smart devices ..but ok i compromised on it but major problem is that without voice control remote it is too difficult to handle youtube internet prime video etc....so i m telling you if you r buying tht tv plz go for voice enabled remote with tht tv ...except this performance is good

"
"

  Received broken item, given request for return.

"
"

  I bought Samsung wondertainment HD series 32 inch LED tv. Its a fantastic experience with this TV. Everything goes smart. Picture and sound quality is fabulous. Smartness of TV by features as well as look is also very good. Smart remote is easy to use.Its a great experience to buy this TV from Amazon.Thank you Amazon & Samsung.😊

"
"

  Voice recognition not available. Very few app application due to trizen os. Whatsapp,  Google meet, Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Explorer nothing works.

"
"

  When it was working, the product was great. We bought the TV in the first week of August, and within a few days, the TV basically went kaput. We got the company technician to check the TV, and he said there's some problem with a part in the TV. We returned it and got the refund. Didn't expect such poor make from Samsung.

"
"

  Bought this 20 days ago.Samsung has definately reduced the quality of this TV. We can see black line on screen quiet often. Very light weight and easy to carry.So far so good lets see hows it works .

"
"

  At this price point the balance of features and picture quality is just great. The TV was timely delivered and was mounted on the very same day of delivery. Thanks to seller/Amazon for prompt service requests post delivery.

"
"

  Worst ever experience!!! Amazon took 3 weeks to deliver product. Now 5 days past, product is yet to be installed. I'm now thinking why I did a mistake buying a Samsung product.  I should have bought from Reliance Digital or LG product. Done with Samsung.

"
"

  As per the price at which this Smart TV is offered it is definitely a good deal.The picture quality is good and the sound is amazing for a normal size room, you don’t have to use any external speaker.Most of the commonly used applications are available like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Zee5, Hotstar, Apple TV etc.The connectivity and other features are good too.

"
"

  features are very good, People looking for a good Smart TV in this budget just go for it.it will satisfy your expectations more compare to other.

"
"

  3rd class service of amazon as well as samsung. Its been a month now. I bought this tv and its not working properly. There is no voice at all. Company person came and repaired it 3 times and same isaue next day. This is definitely a manufacturing defect and now they are refusing to change the tv. Very very very very very poor service of amazon and Samsung

"
"

  You are not allowed to download any apps.you get only prime netflix zee5 and YouTube as built in applications,not all the promised applications were given.picture quality is worse.audio quality is great.i am facing issues casting my laptop to TV,which worked fine on the 1st day.the very main purpose pf buying this TV,casting,is not served.

"
"

  Altough the tv is good but samsung do not coperate also amazon both cos i brought this telivision almost 10 days before still i didnt get any samsung intallation technician and i have complaint 8-10 times still i was given fake promises and i am dissatisfy

"
"

  I AM ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED WITH THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT PROVIDED BY SAMSUNG. 16 DAYS AFTER PURCHASE OF THE PRODUCT AND ITS STILL NOT INSTALLED. SUPPORT IS NON EXISTENT AND TOTALLY UN RESPONSIVE. BUT STILL WARRANTY STARTS FROM PURCHASE DATE

"
"

  Smart features like wiseNetflix, prime video, zee5 and youtube , not working directly with TV remote.Picture quality and on HD is super fine but voice quality in HD mode is not clear, as feel voice is echoing.Voice Recognition function is not working.

"
"

  Nice Smart TV. Everything is good except absence of direct connection for Sound system. Sound system only be connected via Bluetooth. Am able to cast mobile screen also. So I like this TV very much.

"
"

  Crappy product, refused to switch on during the 2nd day of usgae.Avoid this particular model at all costs. Not sure if Samsung is using a crappy transformer or low cost power circuitry.

"
"

  Most affordable smart TV by Samsung.Netflix, Prime, Zee5, YouTube and morePaid only 14,000/-

"
"

  With this budget smart features is excellent, have not tried voice recognition and picture quality is meets the HD standard, overall it will definitely meets your expectations.It's always Happy to shop with Amazon 😎👍

"
"

  They could not install TV on time, so had to return it after 10

"
"

  Not fulfilled the expectation..The picture quality is satisfactory,not good.The voice recognition was poor...USB doesn't support multiformat.The UI is not smooth as it is in other samsung tv.If you can spend another ₹1000 better go for sony 32 inch HD non smart tv and buy tv stick separately..Its way better than others..

"
"

  I bought this for Rs 12849 (T4340)*Picture Quality is fine*Audio Quality is also good*Slim and looks stylish*Colour Quality is also well*SD channels are also give HD feelingInstallation was free of cost, but it took about 3 days after delivery due to holidays

"
"

  Happy on this TV. Smart features good. Picture quality and audio system excellent than expected. Alexa voice recognition good. Most satisfied.

"
"

  I brought this (2nd Samsung Smart TV in my house) for my mother’s room and she likes it very much. Extremely happy that I selected this TV for its great screen and voice features although Mom does not use the smart features.

"
"

  Overall the TV is good and you get a brand satisfaction of samsung which most people looks for... Picture quality is nice, i wont say excellent but its satisfying... Voice recognition feature can be better with 1 or 2 updates.... Otherwise you can totally buy it and you won't regret....

"
"

  Good picture quality...  Prime , Netflix , YouTube and zee5 is preinstalled , sound could be better , still better than many TV's in this price range .

"
"

  Its the best product in this price range with a lots of useful features.Best part is the screen mirroring and the Sound quality of this television. I am very satisfied with this product.Thanks Samsung and thanks Amazon for a great product of my need.

"
"

  Bad experience from Samsung installation... No one came until now... No wall stand given to me.... Don't know how to avail Netflix 6 month's subscription offer... Very bad experience from Samsung installation......

"
"

  I didn't like the brand because of their delay in installation support.. not even a single call was received from the samsung team.. do recheck before buying.

"
"

  Picture quality and sound quality is very good.Samsung service engineer not given the visit to my place for installation.  I remind them several times.

"
"

  This smart TV is one amazing product I have purchased. It indeed is smart. Just one click and we have all the apps openend. The picture quality is crazy and the sound system is bombastic. To add to it Alexa is like topping on the ice cream. Thank you Samsung for the amazing product and thank you Amazon for selling it to us.

"
"

  Don't buy this...Only one day working. Second day suddenly sound in tv. Tv is dead. No replace.....No body support...Cheeting seller...Duplicate product....Beware of this.......

"
"

  Sound not working and product items already open who did this I got second hand product battery also put in remote

"
"

  1. Picture quality is very good compared to Chinese Brand Tv.2. Product quality is good.3. Best at this price range.4. This smart tv is is based on tizen os which doesn't have much app compared to Android based Tv.5. Home interface could be bit better.

"
"

  CONS: Sound quality is not clear, that to if the fan is running can't hear the voices clearly. Same problem with my 2 year old samsung 43 inch Series 5 ""43M5570"" model TV as well. Kindly improve on the same.Pros: Picture quality is too good, smart features works well.

"
"

  I got faulty product and it HDMI port is not working. I am not getting any response from neither Samsung nor Amazon. It was one of the biggest mistake to choose Samsung over various other brand

"
"

  Awesome TV in this range.Picture quality, sound quality both are good. If u looking to purchase TV in this range, go for it. Best from Samsung. Delivery was also before time and installation on the very next day.

Sounds and picture quality is awesome. In this price range ifyou are getting samsung in this price range trust me this is really worth. Value for money.

"
"

  -Excellent picture quality-Excellent sound-Excellent looks-Quality product

"
"

  Received heavily damaged screen

"
"

  Caution: Dont buy, I got 24inch damaged LG TV.

"
"

  Obviously a brand product fullfilled all purpose without compromise with the quality.It's a great Smart tv by Samsung with good price.

"
"

  TV received is damaged, motherboard issue as per the engineer, please replace it.

"
"

  Smart buy for smart price, but obe thing need to highlight hear, i was eligible for ICICI Bank debit card EMI offer which was flat Rs.1499 off on EMI, but i didn't get this offer as the payment was getting decline again and again. Hence miss the offer.

  BEST TV I HAVE SEEN A GOOD PRODUCT BY SAMSUNG BUT I WILL TELL YOU TO USE BIXBY VOICE ASSISTANT AS IT IS BETTER THAN AMAZON ALEXA

"
"

  1 Remote mic is not working properly2 No google assistant3 Installation and delivery is Good

"
"

  The TV is awesome. Smart features & picture quality is super cool. Sound output is little low. You need to attach Bluetooth speakers to get better sound output.

"
"

  This was my first Samsung brand purchase. Below are my reviews after using it for 2 months.1. Sound - Best in the business2. Picture - Perfect3. Bluetooth - Decent4. Tizen Store - Supports almost all apps like Playstore5. Voice Assistant - Loving Bixby

"
"

  Sound and picture quality amazing. But voice search not working. Demo person had no knowledge about tv and features. Very irritating. Service worst.

"
"

  Bad support from customer care side. I have a problem of full screen view when connecting with mobile. Still now problem not shutout by CC team or any service station.

"
"

  I bought this product on Amazon sale.  And it's worth price. Saler wrongly mentioned that it has bluetooth. Other than every information is correct.Nice product, awesome sournd quality and most of the apps are available .

"
"

  Good quality picture, sound. Samsung rep installed TV very next day of delivery by Amazon. Very good service.

"
"

  Good quality TV, excellent picture quality, remote control is also controlled by voice, sound quality is also good, You can't install other apps of your choice like hotstar, it's a drawback. Apps choice is limited,

"
"

  Good product in this budget range. quality and sound ok. We got free installation by Samsung after delivery.

"
"

  The television is good with all the necessary features ....the voice enabled remote is good ...the picture quality is also very nice ....it's good value for money

"
"

  In this price I can buy mi 50 inch Android tv, but I didn't buy it.Samsung plz establish your companies in India and sell everywhere.Make In India....

"
"

  Low weight , high in tech ,superb outlook but sound quality is little less , picture quality is good under price range .

"
"

  Overall it's a good tv and deliver in a seal package, and good for a small room. while quality I doubt that samsung has  focus on it as the tv which I received has a faulty remote control but samsung service center replaced as if now. hope all good as if now.

"
"

  It is overall a very good smart Tv at this price point but it doesn't have bluetooth or voice assistant.....sound quality is decent...Picture quality is awesome....samsung is one of the best tv company so just go for it... you'll never be disappointed.

"
"

  Extra app can't download, except pre-installed appSmart features not available, you can't install extra app except pre-installed app, i am unabe to download Jio TV app

"
"

  As expected. Very good tv. Got it at 13.5k.smart features are very easy to operate

"
"

  very good product my order damaged but easily replacement♥️♥️♥️ an i think this support only 720p resolution but i see 1080p resolution. very good samsung products colours are very very good, i suggested for you this price is gpod product.  (Thanks Samsung's Team♥️)

"
"

  Its a best model one can go for without any second thought. Almost all smart features are boxed with one smart remote..voice assistants built in. Easy sharing with mobiles and many more..sound quality awesome with Dolby atmos output..no second thought to buy...5 stars...

"
"

  Simply waste, dont trust the reviews. Better by samsung products in showroom. Worthless.

"
"

  Samsung service is bad. I have called so many times for my installation. They will take all the dtails at snail pace and invariably the line will be disconnected.

"
"

  Picture quality and voice recognition is excellent. Prompt delivery with good care and no damages .  Highly satisfied .

"
"

  Voice recognition feature is not upto the mark and no wall mount kit provided in the box.

"
"

  Quality is superb nd sound is good. Installation done on same day of delivery. No comparison of Samsung brand with Chinese tv.

"
"

  Delivery was ahead of schedule & prompt installation by Samsung team. Due to the Onam festivity there is a special warranty of additional two years that Samsung extends for its products if company is installing. Request to share the approved warranty to the users.

"
"

  I bought samsung TV last month and within 10 days it got spoiled, poor quality, dont buy from AmazonAlso not getting any replies from samsung about it

"
"

  Good picture quality, easy to use remote functions, very clear sound quality. Good product at this price range and trust of Samsung. Also very prompt, efficient, safe and quick delivery from Amazon.

"
"

  This product is really incredible. This smart tv has high quality visuals and great sound quality. You can also use it as a desktop pc by just connecting cables. The connection through phone is easy. Overall this smart tv is easy to access. You would love it.

"
"

  TV working amazing and value for money. The only missing things that some apps such TVF play , MX players, Discovery and not supported althoug you can watch them viewing on TV through internet. Good product otherwise. Nice

"
"

"
"

  No comments just love it. OMG what a speed service by Amazon and samsung. I get the product delivered today 11am and installation done at 3pm within in 4hr. Super speed service. And forgot Android tv. This is best in class. Strongly recommend.

"
"

  Picture quality is Good and its  value for your money. On top of that you are buying a branded product.Smart TV in this range is a steal......Go for it.......

"
"

  Delivered on time, installations on same day. overall performance of TV also very good👍

  Smart features and picture quality is excellent. I would have bought a bigger Samsung TV but for my financial constraints. It is my dream to get a bigger screen. I will have it one day from Samsung. Thanks.

"
"

  No one came for installation even after contacting Amazon customer care.i have waited for almost 20 days before opening by box.since it was told by delivery.installation guy will attend and stamp the warranty card.

"
"

  One week over after delivery but nobody call me from samsung for installation. Very bad service by samsung.. didn't expect from samsung

  I purchased this Samsung 32 inch led tv after completing 15 days it suddenly turned off. After given service request, technician visited and said MOTHER BOARD issue. I really disappointed.

"
"

  Very good buy. Satisfied with the product. The sound quality is surprising. Battery is BAHUBALI. Overall very good.No need to hesitate to go for this. That's my personal opinion.

"
"

  PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY GOOD. LACKS AUTO AUDIO EQUALISIER AND ALSO LACKS BROADCASTING AND LIVE TELECAST. THEREFORE 4 STAR

"
"

  No installation Samsung Amazon company

"
"

  This smart TV is wonderful with all the smart options given.. voice assistants, good speakers, display etc.. except that microsoft is not supported.. watch out if you are planning to buy only for microsoft teams.

"
"

  It's totally fine.the picture quality is good.sound is also good ,the smart features are brilliant but voice recognition is just okay not so good.all about it is that reasonable price for such a great featured TV

"
"

  If u want to go trusted nonchina compny.. Samsung is always best... Nyc sound.. Easy installment... Nyc fuction.. Alll over 4.2 out of 5 ....if tv screen fully open with a little edge then it be more designalbe..

  The best in its category, if you are using samsung's latest phone then this is the TV you should be buying, my favorite features ,1.I can cast from anywhere directly to my TV, they have this YouTube livecast feature which needs to be configured first it takes 24 hours to get it verified from YouTube2.For those who saying Bluetooth is not enabled in this TV,  if you can't find it don't say its not , i have this Sony Bluetooth headphones ch700N its a complicated headphone with NFC which dont get easily connected with mobiles without NFC but with smart things app, i can choose the audio output to my bluetooth headphone and watch them seamlessly3. One universal remote which you can use  Alexa/ bixby ,make your DTH remote features copied directly into this remote,even control  audio devices connected to this TV, sleek and quality product3. For 14000 ( I got the sbi card discount) all these features + free installation of wall mount, the best TV with the best price.
