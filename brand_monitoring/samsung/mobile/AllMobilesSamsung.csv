  Camera-pictures quality is superb. Scene optimizer really help in clicking good pictures. Macro and wide camera work well. 64 megapixels pictures have more clarity but it doesn't support zoom.Battery- Once it is charged, it stays day long. Charging speed is very good.Screen-quality is amazing, crisp & clear.Applications- runs smoothly without any lag so far.Sound- Dolbyatmos and equalizer help in improving music quality through earphones. Phone speaker sound is optimum & not too much loud.Consist of dedicated micro sd slot.Phone body is sleek and quiet comfortably fits in hand.Screen fingure print sensor isn't very good sometimes it doesn't recognized.Will add more detail after experience with phone.

  It's made in India product and comparing to specs of Oppo reno 3, it's not worth paying same amount. Also the sim tray is very very delicate. At this price would suggest to ho for Oppo reno 3 pro

  Not very happy with my purchasePros -Good displaySd card dedicated slot.Good battery lifeAverage performance as the processor is mid rangeI love one uiFast chargingVery light weight and handy - easy to use.Cons-Fixed focus front camera - big bummerFingerprint scanner is comparatively slow.Average processor- at this price range you can easily buy flasgship processor phones like OnePlus 7 and Redmi k20 pro.If you really don't care about phone's weight or form factor and one UI as os, refrain yourself from buying this phone and buy a phone with flagship processor.

  I dunno why ppl are facing problems, don't punch your fingers at an angle for the print, and add an extra face recognition in the settings with a beard, it will unlock face recognition at any vertical angles , don't turn ur phone sideways.... the battery is excellent, glad I went for this one rather the a80... the camera is  decent and works well as expected, I turned off the beauty features cause it made me look like a cartoon and everything is good now... video recording is an art and can be mastered here well if the ambient lights are supportive, the photographs at different angles using different cameras with focus features shows the intentions of the artist holding the camera really well... developer options in android 10 is fun and I feel like I'm in space sipping a cosmic martini in a meteorite glass with moon rocks for ice... the screen is perfect with the 20:9 display, cutting out the camera hole portion while watching videos so it's not a hindrance... very happy with the product, won't sell this one for years even though I would plan to buy the next android 12 or 13 whatever it would be called...

  It's not a user freindly phone. When I received my phone its data and sms did not work. I complained and fortunately got a replacement but still data and sms receiving is not working.Something is wrong with this model. Twice I have faced the same issue. Total disaster.

  I am writing after a month use. I bought first time Samsung phone and I am not gamer. I want good quality display and data security which serves this phone excellently. And camera samples I have added of day as well of night. In night it won't gives your very nice detailing but it gives natural color which enhances the image quality. Battery get charged fully in 1h-15min from 10% to 100% I have checked it multiple time, so it's time saving and it last more than day for me because I am a moderate user. Yes the cost of the phone is but high that is bad and fingerprint response is little slow but still I am happy with the phone because it gives flagship level feeling?? because of it's design.

  This phone model has extraordinary features. I have a Samsung galaxy Note 9, and i have noticed many features from the high end Samsung Phones to this model.* The look is definitely stunning* after 3 months of extensive use I have no problem at all* fingerprint sensor is little sensitive.  If your finger is not clean,  it'll not detect.* I use this phone for professional purposes, but battery life is extraordinary. One full charge will take you to one and half days with internet on.* Fast charging works fantastic. Charging is very fast.* camera quality is very good. I haven't tried much on low light but otherwise the overall performance of the cameras are great. One thing has to be accepted,  that no matter how costly or best phone you have,  the camera cannot be compared with DSLR  cameras.  A mobile camera has its limitations. If you blow it up it'll be exposed. I recently tried my Note 9 camera for image printing purposes,  and it was exposed.* The RAM is enough for heavy works.  Initially i had 5 gb always free for user out of 8 gb* internal memory still works fine but I believe after spending rs 34999 i should have got a 256 gb internal.  Because of the heavy sizes of the apps and utilities,  you will very soon run out of 100 gb.so the phone's life comes down to 2 years,  despite it's better condition.* Display is stunning and it looks real big with 6.7"". Display quality,  size and features are real high end.* Touch is very smooth and sensitive.* the selfie camera is not so good. I'll rater rate it poor. Samsung needs to really improve on this front. Unnecessarily beautification is used and you'll never get an original shot.Overall I Found the Samsung Galaxy A71 a really good and value for money product.

  both the looks and the performance sets it class apart. if you want an all rounder phone then this is perhaps one of the best. brand samsung is way better than chinese brands. it gives you a very premium feeling when you hold it in hand and definitely attracts other's attention. the super amoled plus display is much more punchier than regular super amoled panel. camera is excellent. !!!

  Let me talk about what I like first:-You get an amazing display and you will fall in love with it!-The 25W charger you get in the box charges phone pretty fast (But not as fast as Warp charge in OnePlus)-You get pretty decent camera setup that can take above average pictures.Here are the things that I do not like:-The charging time is pretty long when compared to other advanced fast charge technologies (Vooc | Warp)-The Macro camera is not up to the mark, they would have made it an 8 MP instead of 5MP. Also Wide Angle is not so good, it gets you disappointed.-The On-Screen finger print sensor is little slow compared to the phones in the same price segment (OnePlus Nord)-They would have given an upgraded processor for the price point, instead of the mid-range processor SD 720.Conclusion: Go for it only if you do not want to go for non-Chinese phone in this price segment.

  Battery life is not good enough. Barely lasts 12 hours. Finger print reader is a good additional feature. Overall, just about value for money. Slightly higher price for the model

  Opted for Samsungz Brand value, but still my analysis of almost a week of use.Pros:1. Superb display both  color and brighgness wise and in every other aspect  of display u cn think about except gorilla glass protection.2. Top notch security for every aspect related to day2day transactions and media in general3. Enormous options of customization, perfectly creafted U.I for every age group easy to use with all advanced features.4.perfectly balanced front camera, w.r.t colors,dynamic range and all other features u cn expect.5. Lite weight n slimm, very ergonomical design.6. Super fast charging just  75 minutes 2 full charge.7.superb audio quality both from earphones  and Bluetooth speakers  ,Dolby atmos support also adds to the charm.7.Good processor and ram management  for medium to heavy tasks.8. Perfect face unlockCons:1. Just Average camera w.r.t sharpness especially was expecting  way more at this price than wot actually got.2. Battery drain fast than it is expected to b.3. Build quality average, plastic ,no metal /glass use .4.Gorilla glass 3 screen protection is used ,it must be gorilla glass 5 atleast.5.Finger print reader is not very responsive takes time, sometimes  irritating.6. Silicon Cover provided in the box don't cover camerà bump ,cheap quality cover.7. Earphones in the box  are just ok as its a freebie.Verdict: price shud b 25 k max,but if u are not an absolute  camera centric person,this product  won't disappoint you , excluding exceptional camera every other thing is exceptionally gud.

  I have used mobile hotspot for my laptop since the time I purchased A71. My previous mobile had to be charged twice a day. But this Samsung A71 lasts whole day with continuous calls, whatsapp msgs, downloading, candy crush, songs being played and with wifi hotspot on. This was very benificial for those working from home during pandemic.Its light weight. Though I have not used the camera much, I am satisfied with all the pics I have taken. Macro and slow motion selfies are wonderful.A good buy for me.

  A bit on the expensive side, but worth the price. Capable daily driver and will last me 3 years quite well if I do not charge the device aggressively. Battery lasts over 40 hours per charge. Feels quite well in hand with a Spigen TPU case on it. With moderate use of WhatsApp, Microsoft Teams, Reddit, Spotify (3-4hrs screen time per day), the battery lasts well over a day.Pros:It's been almost a month, I have never experience any slowdowns and crashes. I have uninstalled and disabled most of the adware that came with the device, including many of the Galaxy branded apps. Using Microsoft launcher 6 with the same layout of the stock launcher. UI feels really clean and fluid. Camera is good enough, even though it struggles with focusing at times.Cons:Camera image processing still needs work, especially for wide angle and macro. Cannot shoot videos using the macro lens. The case in the box does not protect the camera bump. AMOLED screen in low brightness has uniformity issues. I had to get the device replaced once.

  Bought A70s in Dec 19 and now A71 for its added features. Using this phone for a week gives me satisfaction better than A70s and the fingerprint access is faster, huge 4500 mah fastcharge battery takes less than 150 minutes to complete 100% and face recognition is also faster than its earlier version A70s. Overall total weight is lesser than A70s and it looks fine and worth for its cost.

  Have been using A71 since last 3 months. Was using OP5 earlier. Initially it took time to adjust as the UI was different from OP.Pros -Battery life is good 5/5Superfast charger 5/5Overall a good phone 4/5Screen size is good enoughNo heating issuesCamera is good 4/5Cons-Nothing much as of now.Suggestions-Fingerprint scan needs a slight improvement.PS- the charging port had issues and got it repaired from Samsung service center. Only issue in the service was the process- earlier I thought it was charged issue for that also they scanned the phone which took more than 2 hours (btw scanning couldn't detect the issue at the charging port). After getting new charger it was proved the port had issues. And as per service policy if charger also has issues they would scan the phone and update software which can even have a data loss (which is an BIG issue) and it's mandatory to take the phone along with the charger even if the phone is fine.

  OK phone for the price.Pros1. Screen is too good....Cons1. Poor speakers2. Camera is average for the price we pay3. Fingerprint reader is slow.In my HTC U11+ I could disable any apps which I use rarely.  With this phone I don't have option to disable apps

  As the delivery goes, they delivered in time, no issue.  But as for the phone itself, I think we deserve bit better build quality. plastic build phones are bit finicky overtime compare to glass sandwich. no wireless charge, no ip rating....no problem tho but build quality should have been at its peak when it comes to this price point. chinese phones which costs as this much have much better build quality than this one (at least not plastic tho). I'm not saying that the build quality is bad but for this price a grass sandwich build construction should be available. and this goes towards the samsung btw.

  After using it for 6 months.Pros: Good Battery Life, Awesome display, camera is awesome(9/10), Pubg is running  smoothly (good gaming performance)After updating finger print is working fineCons: there are so many smartphone of the same features under 22K. So  Price should be under 22K

  Galaxy a71 is a great phone. It's most exciting feature for me is it's screen. The super amoled plus screen produces great colors and saturation. The natural and vivid settings can be used to suit all kinds of tastes.The battery lasts for very long and gets fully charged in 80 to 90 minutes. This function is pretty neat on the phone.The camera is also great, both front and back. The 64 mp back camera and 32 mp front camera fulfill my requirements pretty well.These would be the main 3 features of the phone which shine out the most. For me, the other functions work well as well.Just go ahead and buy this phone.

  It's a very good phone with the best features. Amazing camera quality for both stills and video. Supports 4k recording. But the fingerprint reader is one that upsets (I never liked onscreen fingerprint sensor). It could have been a bit more responsive. And once tempered is installed, then registering your fingerprint is a rocket science but once registered it will unlock easily.Just go for it??, the best in it's segment (better than Vivo V19 and Oppo Reno 3 pro) and a strong competitor of OnePlus mobiles. Charging phone is very fast, touch is also very responsive, it's a very beautiful piece of machine. No lags just play any game, multi tasking is very easy, the processor is unmatched.

  I am satisfied with the performance of this phone. I am a normal user and I don't play games. So for daily usage the phone is perfect for me. It has a 6.7 inch screen and 4500 mah battery but it feels very sleek and light in hand. The amoled display is a treat to the eyes. The battery backup is also good. It easily lasts for 1 to 1.5 days. The charging speed is also pretty good. The camera is also fine. I loved the slow motion as well as super slow motion feature on this phone.  The phone also has a screen recorder and I love this feature as well. This phone can be a good alternative for those who are looking for phones for normal usage.

  Frankly speaking, this is my first samsung phone and I was very sceptic about it. But after a month, I must agree that all my doubts were unfounded. The phone is sleek, superfast, super efficient, has a long battery life, beautiful display and a great camera. Though price is slightly on the higher side but it is worth the money.
",,
"
  This phone is worth its price. I'm using this phone from 2 months and it's still that fast and energetic! It supports fast charging, so that it can be charged 100% in 40 minutes and can use upto 1 day! (If you think battery life upto 1 day is very less, please! I use it for online class, youtube, movies, social media, but no games. So its worth it, I'll not lie)

  Battery drained fast though its 4500. Getting slight heat, Camera both front and back also not good though with high megapixel And spending  30k on this phone the  apps , settings  and display  everything  look like same as other lower price Samsung phones

  Received the delivery today. Timely delivery, box sealed, opened box to find the the phone is already in a switched on state. Called for replacement, not happy to have received already opened box... On inspecting the box the corners had cracks...Would have given 5 stars for the product, but the experience calls for 0 stars...

  The product is too good in this price range. People are explaining about finger print reader. It is slow but you need to push it a little bit then it works fine. Its just, you need to make it a habit.

  Pros:1. Good value for money, though the price is a bit on the higher side compared to competitors.  But, must say that the features are in par with any flagship products.2. Battery back-up is good with the memory it offers.3. Quad-Camera is a an advantage of this product.Cons:1. First-time boot was giving some issues and had to reset the phone.  When checked online, I can see the same issue has been experienced by many product owners.2. The build quality is not in par for the price it asks for.  The build quality can be improved with a metallic panel than glastic.  I had to purchase a screen guard, camera guard and back cover to protect the device.

  If you are looking for a midrange premium phone from a reputable brand.... than this phone is for you....it just check all the right boxes for me.... great ""SUPER AMOLED"" display is the best thing on this phone.... and battery easily last for a full day.... gaming is at 40 fps in all the major games hands down with moderate heating.... camera I haven't taken much outdoor shots but its not that bad .... cons.... you need to disable customisation service if you don't want any recommendations (ads) .... overall I am happy that I have gone this phone with all the stuff that's happening right now between India and you know ""whom""..... rest its a great phone if you know how to use it or how to remove the stuff you don't need....

   It has good battery life, charges super fast, camera is great, audio quality is good with Dolby in it... You get an in-ear earphone with it too which is appreciable... It has a 3.5mm jack which is a breather for guys like me with common sense... Movies look good and the games run real smooth... I had an Android one phone before this which was also great, but compared to that Samsung here can record calls, record stuff going on screen, there are a lot of options for themes and stuff, basically you can customize more... It hasn't hung nor I had to restart it and shit to make it work... Overall this is a real nice phone what your money can buy... Real smooth.

  My phone is getting disconnected everytime someone is calling. This is sick. Oppo F7 was working better.Is it a joke ?

  Made in India is why I switched to samsung. Overpriced but features are premium. Build quality is good and Samsung display is amazing. Got in ear headphones with the handset which is rarely provided by the Chinese manufacturers. Fingerprint scanner could have been better, face unlock it fast. Has edge lightning which I love. Has a snapdragon process over exionos but faster one should be provided considering price of the phone

  I've always loved Samsung phones and I had to unexpectedly buy the A71 as my previous phone S7edge of 3 years, slipped from my hand and fell on it's face corrupting the display. I went on to find out which cell phone would be ideal to buy and came across the A71.. i ordered it from Amazon the same day and when I received it, I couldn't be happier. With face recognition, amazing battery life, full screen experience, onscreen fingerprint scanner and the list goes on. I am really happy with this phone and recommend the A71 to everyone.. not only is it budget friendly but has all the latest specs.

  Its a very good phone with all the goodies rolled into one. Battery life, very good RAM and quick charge plus auxiliary audio output . A little down slide is a camera when compared to galaxy s10 lite. But the latter one misses the auxiliary output. And is more pricey than s 71.

  The phone is awsome. Great to hold. Inhand feel is very good. Camera is awsome. 5 star for it. Fingerprint sensor is slow as u cn find out in most of the youtube reviews but that is not a big point fr me. The phone is feature laden with samsung pay, single take camera feature, edge lighting etc. Performance of the phone is also good. I dnt play heavy games on phones but the games which i played ran smoothly in the phone. Charging time is just ovr 1hr15mins from 15% to 100%. The person who will buy this phone will love it.

  Battery life and fingerprint reader tried and found satisfactory. Face recognition didn’t try so far. Price 33000/- is bit higher but happy as is made in India.

  It is a wonderful phone. The experience has been pretty much overwhelming and I'm really enjoying the handset.Pros:1. The screen is absolutely gorgeous to look at. I have seen other AMOLED panels from Xiaomi, Realme and even OnePlus but none match this one.2. The performance is pretty good. It feels snappy, no lag or crashes anywhere. Every app opens in a jiffy and there is no hang anywhere. I have also played Call of Duty and Asphalt quite heavily and they ran at the highest visual settings while maintaining very good fps.3. The camera is the best in class. Anyone eyeing at A71 would already be knowing that it has best camera in a phone below the 30k price. I am really surprised how well the cameras(both the front and back) work, even in low-light. With gcam mod installed, it performs extremely well. The photos are rich, detailed, sharp and contrasty. The portrait mode also works very nice. No issues whatsoever.4. Battery life is good. No issues there. Easily lasts me over a day with moderate gaming, heavy movie watching and using other apps. The fast charge is also quite handy and time saving.5. The overall build is very sturdy yet pretty slender and sleek. Even though the back is made of mostly plastic, you won't be able to tell. It looks gorgeous and the benefit of a glastic back is that it won't shatter if it falls.6. The audio through the audio jack is very very good. The included earphones are a bonus. I wasn't expecting them and to my surprise they sound very good, slightly better than the Realme bluetooth earphones. So, no complaints here.7. Having used stock android, zen ui, miui and colour os, I can firmly say that Samsung's One UI is better than all of them. Obviously it is not as fast as a stock android but the difference is so small I guess you wouldn't even be able to discern it. The OS is very intuitive, easy to use and has many useful features and functionalities which make it probably one of the best android implementation out there (if not the best).Cons:I do not found any cons till now.I hope you found my review useful.

  First that aspect which could've been better! Battery is not as powerful as to match the addiction that you might get into using the phone. You certainly need longer battery life to keep going on this device. What I liked the most is the amazing camera and its features! Its just incomparable in this price range! If you like photography using camera, go for this one! The next best thing about this device is it it powerful! Superb RAM and huge storage for everything that you need to store. Multitasking is not a problem. I have been using this device for more than 3 months without boot issues. If you're looking for a device that is powerful, with very good camera in this price-range, go for it! You will NOT regret.

  It is a wonderfully phone. I am using Samsung's A71 for about  3 months.The experience  is very good and it have meet my expectations.The screen is sensitivity  is very fast and awesome. The Performance  of the phone is pretty good,there is no lag or delay. You could  find  only best class camera with this price range.The battery life is good,without  any issues.I am happy to get a earphone as a bonus.The fast chartering facility  is quite time saving.So overall It is wonderful  device and worth money.I would  recommend  this phone who have more money to spend to get a fantastic  phone.

  This is a samsung phone so expect it to be fast.Coming to the looks of the device, I bought the crushed blue variant which is soothing to the eyes and is just amazing.Camera- Seriously amazing, I have google pixel 3 with me and though A70 camera can't compete with it, it's not bad either, camera samples that I have added, if you look closely in the pic where I am on the bike, my shoulder lining as well as chrome colored mirrors are stable and stationary, i.e, the lining is there with crisp clear details so dept camera knows what it's doing as the truck just behind the shoulder and mirror is in motion and is clearly visible.Display- ummm too good, screen size is adequate and nice.All In All good phone, after all it's samsung.

  I am writing this review after a week of using the phone and till now the overall performance has been satisfying. I was earlier a One Plus user and this is the first time I am using Samsung. Lets go through the pros and cons:PROS:i. Camera quality is excellent, both front and rear. The selfie camera is crisp and the main rear camera gives great shots with good detailing. The ultra wide camera is also quite useful. Overall the quad camera setup delivers good performance while taking photos.ii. Battery is very good. Lets me go through the entire day with moderate to heavy usage easily and there is still some left.iii. Charging is impressively fast with the super fast charger.iv. The 6.7 inch full HD display is superb to watch videos and play games. I use this regularly now to watch football.v. The device is fast and without any lag.vi. 128 Gb of internal storage coupled with an additional 128 Gb as external, gives you ample space to store lots of stuff.vii. Build quality look premium and feels good in hand. Although the back is made of plastic, still there is a premium feel.viii. It has slots for 3 sims!!! Not that I use it, but still can be handy for some users.ix. The earphones that come with the device are pretty good.CONS:i. Fingerprint sensor is very slow and sometimes does not detect even in 5 attempts.ii. As a 2020 phone, expected to have 5G support but does not.iii. I had already mentioned that having a big screen is an added advantage. But on the contrary, having such a large screen heavily messes up with the aspect ratio of the phone. Hence, when you fill videos to the entire screen, you lose a lot of area at the top and bottom.iv. I miss having a LED on the top of the screen which would glow in different colors for notifications from various sources. This was there in One Plus and the facility come in very handy to know if any important notification is there without having to unlock the device.Overall, the phone is good value for money priced at 31k and one of the best at its price range.

  The phone is simply overpriced. You can get similar features from other much cheaper phones too. I bought this just because I didn't want to go with those cheaper Chinese options.Coming to the phone, it is good on most aspects. Display is awesome, cameras are fantastic, call quality great, and performance up to the mark. The finger print scanner is not upto the mark for a phone at this price range. The memory management could be better for a smoother experience. I guess I am feeling this more because my older phone was stock android, and oneUI definitely introduces some lags. Google has ensured that stock android stays out of the midrange segment.Overall it's okay. Not something mind blowing. Not something that's trash. And definitely not value for money. The new M51 coming out with the same SD 730G chip, if priced lower than this, will definitely be more VFM.

  I purchased this through Amazon.in. Its a very nice mobile and very reliable product like all other Samsung products.It has got a Super Battery backupGood fast chargingBig displayGood speackerVery good build quality and designCamera and video quality is fineNo one can beat samsung Amoled display, excellent display quality. Just change some settings for more clarity on Samsung phones.Overall a great product.

  The Samsung  Galaxy A71 has very good video and audio quality. Overall, this is a good phone if you don't want to spend a lot of money on a Samsung S series one. The A71 offers a larger display. The charging is extremely fast as it comes with 25W Super Fast Charging.The handset fits comfortably in your hand and has a stylish look. The camera takes amazing shots. With great modes including night mode, live focus and macro. I've only been able to capture such amazing photos on a DSLR camera before but the A71 takes them with ease. There's no lens flare and the AI processing of the images is effortless.The only downside to the handset is lack of IP68. It means being extra careful when using near any source of water. Otherwise, this would be a near-perfect phone. The phone back is glossy smooth, and and has a premium finish to it.Some mid-range phones tend to have a cheap feel to them, almost feeling like they could break easily. This handset is quite solid to hold.
",,
"
  Delivery was prompt and easy.The phone itself is easy to use. It has all the features you require with enough RAM to ensure it supports all regular apps. Mine also came with a clear cover.
",,
"
  So the A71 is good phone for the price. Especially since it the Snapdragon SOC. There are some things here and there which are mildly disappointing. It came with a bunch of preinstalled apps which, yes can be removed easily, but is still a hassle.The haptic motor isn't too great. The vibration for the default keyboard doesn't. I use GBoard but even that doesn't get any vibration. Could've been a little bit better.The macro lens isn't bad, needs decent amount of lighting tho. Some of the Samsung apps installed are good. Especially the AR Zone.Overall, good enough. For the price.

  I bought Samsung Galaxy A71 five months back. I just simply loved this phone. Also I am a Samsung user. If you are too go for it.1. Super Battery backup.2. Very fast charging.3. Big Sreen display.4. Speaker is very good.5. Camera and video quality is awesome.6. Fingerprint is a little slow but its fine.No one can beat samsung Amoled display, its excellent.The look of this phone is the best with an Infinity-O-display which makes it the bestAlso, its a good thing that Samsung still provides earphones with the purchase of a mobile earphones unlike other company.

  My experience: Super Battery backup Good fast charging Big display Very good quality fingerprint reader, superdesign Camera and video quality is excellent  No one can beat samsung Amoled display, excellent display quality.

  Very nice and sturdy phone. Camera is beyond imagination. Must have for all IT folks have lot of smart feature. If you are the one who don't get time to browse all phone features and busy with your daily work, go for it. This phone has lot of smart reminder features which makes your life easier.
",,
"
  The phone has a good look and feel. It fits nicely into hands. The back of the phone gives a little rainbow-like reflective look when seen in light.The performance for day-to-day activities of smartphone is really good.Touch is quite smooth and feels like feather.Camera is good. Macro camera is fantastic. Samsung phone cameras usually make the pictures pop-out.Battery drains quickly. With the normal usage of attending phone calls (around 1-2 hours in total), checking social media notifications occasionally, keeping location/bluetooth off,  no video streaming, the battery hardly lasts for a day.Samsung UI 2.0 is a nice UI which offers the user a lot more customization as per his usage than available in normal stock android.Fingerprint reader is decent, face recognition is excellent.Samsung Pay is fully enabled. Knox security is fully enabled. Bixby is a good AI for doing anything related to your phone like searching documents, setting alarms, checking weather etc. Else, Google assistant is unmatchable for searching anything outside.Review after 3 months of usage.

  Confused situation for me.... I brought this phone on 5th Sep. Since then it was working fine.... and return date was 12th September.  However  the phone is not working with the mobile signals since 14th September....If I have wifi... then it works well with all the applications but if I am going out and using either  Gpay/ phonepay/ paytm the camera doesn't  open and its getting stuck. My return window is also closed now...  wondering what to do now :(
",,
"
  When i open box, it felt like i am getting used product (box was broken, maybe someone retu this package and then I got this product). I am loosing trust on online Shopping as I am getting multiple times used product.Product wise , it is good phone.Fingerprint sometimes unresponsive.

  This is my first samsung phone, i previously used moto g2, redmi note 3 and Poco F1. I was pretty surprised when i started to use Galaxy A71 cause One UI is such a thoughtful take on android unlike other android phones available in the market. They've engineered it for the large screen and it shows right from the first boot. Fingerprint scanner in most reviews weren't positive but it was shocking to me as this turned out to be the opposite, i know it's not as fast as the dedicated fingerprint scanner but for a normal user you won't be able to discern the speed difference. The screen is something that will impress you especially if ur used to LCD pannels and cheaper alternatives, the infinity o notch and thin bessels gives a premium feel. Battery life is very good easly lasts a day of heavy usage and with light usage can last two days without an issue. The speaker though mono is loud, call quality is stellar no issues what-so-ever. The phone is slim, tall and light easy for long video calls. Now to camera quality tweak a little in the settings to your liking you will love the camera quality, you can even install Gcam. There's widevine l1 support for hd video streams from Netflix and Prime, with sAmoled plus panel all videos are a treat to watch. In short i would like to suggest this phone over all other phones in this price range as it's a Made in India phone as well as it's powered by a Snapdragon 730 chip and 8gb ram that's more than capable to power all type of usages without much heating.

  My Samsung A71 whenever I receive/dial any phone call... The call remains connected but the sound did not reach the recipient and I'm also not able to listen to what the other person on the call is speaking the problem continues unless I restart the phone... I have to repeat the same 3-4 a day....also there is some problem with the sound sometimes the speakers stop working. really disappointed with Samsung

  Wow....this is the first time I had samsung handset which is unbelievable!!!!! I choosen this galaxy A71 above all Chinese handsets because of its screen quality,hardware quality and software, and the Knox security which is remarkable....This handset will definitely attract you that Iam damn sure..camera is Just Wow....the super slow motion videos you will shot on this phone is superb...You can see more youtubers compare this phone with ultra premium phones....so without thinking  go and grab this phone..you can compare this phone with M31s which has 6000mah b8g battery ..I hust typed what comes my mind firstly...Iam not an expert to tell each and everything...this phone make u happy....iam sure

  I have purchased this Mobile on it's launching day..! Although it is budget premium phone, it is not less than any premium phone! Fingerprint reader is sensitive. Battery is also good.when you recharge it at morning ,you have not need to find charger on whole big day. Overall it is  awesome product.

  The phone has stopped charging now in about 45 days of normal usage. Samsung authorised service centre says they do not have spares/ports to find out the issue. Fingers crossed.  Fingerprint scanning is not fast & average battery (doesn't feel like 4500 mAh)
",,
"
  Although A71 specs are good, it's not at all worth it.The phone hangs or becomes very less responsive when we move from battery saver mode to normal mode. It takes nearly 10mins to come to become responsive.Battery life is horrible, everyday I must charge my phone although I do not use facebook, instagram, Twitter or videos.

  I am in love with the display and the processor.Camera is decent.Not bad but not good too.My old Nokia 7plus was far better than this camera.Fingerprint reader is slow but you will get use to it. Battery is ok not exceptional. I heard irs battery backup was upto more than 1 day for moderate user. I only used it for Instagram, YouTube, Facebook and WhatsApp. I have to charge it twice in a day. Maybe because of Lockdown we are using our phone more than usual.Over all, Phone is good but overpriced. Samsung really needs to to check it's price for midranged phones.

  Earlier  samsung  mobile phones were too slow and battery back up even worst but with this A series phone Samsung  emerged  as competitive to MI. Even in price segment I would rather suggest to go with  Samsung. FINALLY  everyone  knows the current situation  between 2 COUNTRIES so I will definitely prefer  Samsung

  Overall design - Great!Fingerprint response - QuickBattery life - Good as promised.Performance - Fast and smooth, no lags while multitasking.Display - The best among all (vibrant colors) also the brightness can be reduced to the lowest with helps at night time usage, keeps your eyes cool.Camera - A big disappointment, pictures lack contrast and saturated the both primary and secondary camera doesn't capture bright and deep colors correctly. Refer demo pictures.Overall a good phone but not worth 31000 thousand rupees.

  The phone is one of it's kind. You gotta feel the grip it gives you also the the true colors of amoled screen gives you a wonderful experience.  Camera quality is best in the segment. Loved the phone

  Well overall its is okay the infinity o display gives the feel of flagship phone camera is good  battery is also good everything is good except for processor.. you can play games without lag or anything although there is shutter when browsing through insta but it's rare I guess it happens once or twice a month but everything else works well and good

  I am using this phone for last 7 days and sharing experience.I'm not a heavy user, I use phone for social media and streaming.I didn't face any lag. Interface is really good.Pictures taken from camera are processed one means not natural. So if you like processed images to upload on social media.Also it has knox security,  altZlife , NFC like features.So in conclusion it's a phone for business purpose.

  Excellent mobile with smooth performance, value for money, beautifully built, superb display and good Camera setup; only in place of a micro lens, there should have been a telephoto lens, as there is not much requirement of the former!

  Got my handset 2 days back...I ordered for a prism crush silver but got haze crush silver ....but this one is beautiful ??...so kept it ...and the performance ..I jv just started exploring it ...n believe me its awesome ...the display is so beautiful n totally super amoled...I wish the processor was the latest one snapdragon 855 but 730 g is not bad...so of you have a bigger budget go for another 855 processor wala Samsungphone....but overall its awesome ??..Happy shopping guys!

  Every physical spec is given by the manufacturer. But why Samsung haven't mentioned about DOLBY ATMOS, this phone is having DOBLY ATMOS Function.It gives great sound quality.I will say great value for money instead.

  Samsung A71 is very good phone. Very stylish design & superb quality & performance.  However this phone is not ment for hard-core gamers....as this has 60hz screen.

  Seamless transfer of data from my earlier Android handset to Samsung Galaxy A71through a Samsung switch. I could start using the new handset in just few minutes. A71 has a fast processor and 64 MP camera. You will get amazing picture clarity. But some of the colours (e.g. Red) gets filtered and appear in a different shade. Have been using it for one month. So far so good !

  charging cable for A71 comes with C type on both end therefore u cannot connect USB port of PC for file transfer.this is the major drawback of this phone in my opinion and have to spend another 600 rupee to buy authentic usb cable.  therefore i have rated 3 stars . As far as performance is concerned its good let see how it goes in long run.

  Nice mobile but Headphone and charger missing in box to Amazon
",,
"
  After almost 2 months of usage... can say not a bad phone to have. Didn't find anything specific for complaining about the phone.
",,
"
  Overall budget phone but lacks camera quality in comparison to other similar cost phones. The images are very dull, some times blurry. All reviews mentioning about excellent camera have no clue.
",,
"
  The battery charger looks old soiled though manufacturing date is Feb 2020.Photos enclosed

"
  Horrible.Its just two months and the earphone that was given by samsung with 6months warranty has stopped working

  Light weight phone with awesome display touch screen. However, finger print takes few attempta to unlock

  Amazing mobile phone. Looks classy. Beautiful fingerprint reader. First time ever in my life so much satisfied with Samsung device. Thank you amazon for timely delivery. Definitely go for it.
",,
"
  It's an amazing phone with great camera quality but what's a drawback is the colour as it isn't pure black & looks more faded which I don't like but anyways it has a cool look & everything about it is great.??
",,
"
  Overall happy with the performance. I am really enjoying  using this phone.  It's  been a month and I found no lag yet.
",,
"
  Its a very nice phone..however the fingerprint sensor doesn't register new fingerprint once the tempered glass is put. So please register the fingerprint before fixing tempered glass.
",,
"
  Samsung is awesome as always. Samsung is the best option for the one who is thinking to purchase smartphone.Simply to say A71 met all the expectations I wanted!Special thanks to Amazon for timely delivery .
",,
"
  The camera quality and other features are awesome but I faced a problem with the charging slot within 20 days of purchase. My phone is not getting charged then what is the use if other good features!!!
",,
"
  I dislike this model because of its very low battery performance. i.e battery drainage is more hence frequent charging becomes mandatory. But no complaints in other areas. Everything else is sooo good.
",,
"
  Phone is awesome. Camera quality is good.finger print reader, battery life and face recognition is good.Overall better phone comparing to China phones in the same range.

"
  Best phone in budget. Camera quality, battery life, Finger prient all are in best performance. No heating problem . Reviewed all these after two month of use so surely a nice piece.
",,
"
  This is very good phone in the 25k to 35 k range. Lots of good features and excellent display. Finger print may be little slow but never mind
",,
"
  A71 is the worst phone I ever had. Within 2 months twice the display has gone. Bad phone. Not recommended
",,
"
  Very poor performance...battery life is not good..not supporting camera in WhatsApp...unsatisfied ..i don't recommend anybody to buy this.

  A series is a luxury phones

  The phone is best in this price range. Fingerprint sensor and both front and back camera are awesome. Could have had a better battery life.  Overall happy with performance and speed.

"
  Its more than what i expected.  Excellent camera experience...a little doubt on finger print scan.  Excellent battery back up.  No doubt it gives value for money spent.
",,
"
  Using this phone since 2 weeks. Overall performance is good. Fingerprint and face recognition are very disappointing. Screen doesn't wake during calls when moved away from face.
",,
"
  Product is good but sometimes it hangsI bought 8GB just to avoid this but unfortunately the performance not upto the markCamera quality is also inferior

  Superb featured phone in this range. Camera quality can be compared with iphone XR.

  Phone is very good. But Price is high. A71 is much better than Samsung M31s and M51. So you can purchase Samsung's A71. It's lighter weight.

  As per features and battery life - price must be under 25000Camera quality is good

  A very quick and simple review of Samsung Galaxy A71~Design• Crushingly beautiful 'Prism' design, as soon as the light hits the back, there is a captivating blast of colours - it's a stunning view for sure!• It is a pleasure to hold, handle, and use as a daily driver - the frame provides just enough grip to make it secure in hand, while the slim profile helps in keeping it pocket and one-hand friendly• It manages to stay quite slim and lightweight (by today's standards) - the Galaxy A71 is just 7mm thin and weighs 179g• In-display fingerprint sensor is neither the fastest nor the more accurate~ Display• Absolutely gorgeous, 6.7-inch Super AMOLED display, with a tiny punch-hole camera and a near bezel-less design - you get vibrant colours and perfect inky blacks, as well as good sunlight legibility• Video viewing and gaming experience on the giant display is an absolute delight - as far as media consumption goes, this is simply one of the best phones out there, period~ Software• Running the Galaxy A71 is Samsung's OneUI 2 on Android 10 - which, as far as Android UIs go, is one of the most refined, well thought-out experiences• There are many useful add-ons on board - like gesture navigation, and a great 'dark' mode• Samsung Pay makes the cut too, making this the cheapest phone to sport the full version of the payments app, which will be especially useful if your transactions largely rely on card payments~Performance• Good performance backed by the powerful Snapdragon 730 SoC, 8 GB of RAM, and super fast UFS storage - everything from daily use to complex games like PUBG is fairly smooth (add that to the ridiculously wide display, and all gamers are in for a treat)• Having said that, there are certainly even better performing competitors around, like the realme X2 Pro with it's top of the line Snapdragon 855 Plus CPU~Camera• Good quad-camera setup on the back with a primary 64MP sensor, a secondary ultra-wide 12MP shooter, a 5MP Macro and a 5MP depth sensor• The default 16MP photos from primary camera are good - detail is enough, dynamic range is very good, the colours are lively and saturated and the noise reduction works well• The new 12MP ultra-wide camera is a notable upgrade over the old 8MP shooter in the Galaxy A70s in both resolution and picture quality - there is more detail, better sharpness, the colours are punchy, and, of course, you can fit a lot more in the frame• The Galaxy A71 shoots good portraits, subject detection and separation are very good, and the blur looks just right• Low light photos are decent from both primary and ultra-wide cameras and the night mode helps further in getting more light and reducing noise• Good video recording performance with good detail levels, including some impressive slow-mo video recording with great stabilisation• Good front camera - the 32-megapixel sensor does a good job with nice colours and wide dynamic range, the details are quite good as far as selfie cameras go• The 5MP macro camera is average, it has fixed focus so getting the focus right is difficult and the final output isn't that great• Overall, for the price bracket, the camera package on the Galaxy A71 is good, but not the best - you will find better camera phones in the competition~Audio• The bundled in-ear earphones, when paired with Dolby Atmos, makes for a pretty good audio experience• The loudspeaker is decent (though not exceptional)~ Battery• Very good battery life with a large 4500 mAh battery - it will comfortably last you a day or more, even with that large display• There is also fast charging on-board, with the included 25W charger it takes 81 minutes for a full charge__________________________________________~Verdict• The Galaxy A71 is a good all-rounder and a tangible upgrade over the A70s - the large, beautiful Super AMOLED display + the big battery + Dolby Atmos support - make for an excellent media consumption device• Having said that, both realme and Xiaomi are bringing meaningful innovation to their phone, be it higher watt charging, smooth display or top of the line performance, things which are not seen in the Galaxy A71 - in their comparison, the Galaxy A71 get a little overshadowed------------------------------------------------------Buy at a discount of 15% here --> https://amzn.to/2U5RvHb___________________________________________

  This mobile has software problem it seems, within 10 days of usage it hangs a lot. Also it has mic problem, when you attend the call the caller at the other end won’t be able to hear you, you need to restart the mobile for couple of time then it works. I can’t use it like this for longer run, please help me to return the product, I will handover the mobile by doing factory reset. Please review and help as soon as possible.

  I bought this for 8990.. Now it has reduced to 8399.. The product is worth the price. Before buying make of the purpose of the usage.. This is a budget phone and is not for gaming.. My dad needed a phone which has decent battery life and whatsapp for official usage.. He doesn't use it for anything else... I wanted to buy only Samsung phone. I finally concluded to buy this..Pros.1. Good battery life.2. Size is not big. Hence easy to carry. (This might be a con for few)3. Doesn't heat while charging/ normal usage. Though few have complained of heating. However I didn't experience any heating issue.4. Low sar. (0.61 W/kg- head). I particularly check for SAR value before buying.5. Doesn't heat on normal usage.  This depends on how u define ""Normal"". The apps my dad use are few banking apps, Whatsapp, YouTube, and for office use6. Smooth UI7. Android 10 with latest security update.8. Good call quality. Even after hours of calling it didn't heat up.Cons.Can't complain about these coz you get what u pay for.. Lack of fingerprint scanner and slow charging are to name a few.. Samsung can include a screen guard too. :)However getting a Samsung phone for this price is really worth.. Samsung= Quality & Reliability.Samsung is an innovative brand. They spend lots of money for R&D to bring out new feature. So when I pay for Samsung Iam paying for innovation. :)I will be buying M31 s in next sale.. Samsung 4ever! :)

  Don't buy any Mobile from Amazon if you are not fully aware abaout the product. After buying they are not entertain you for returning/replacement. Pathetic customer support by customer care service.Very upset from Amazon, they are only making money from India with cheap policies.They are asking to download an waste app in your phone which has 1.8 rating on play store and asking you for permission of  your personal information.And yes this mobile has very cheap quality and only sold due to less option in Indian market. Only samsung mobile left in market if you don't want to buy any Chinese mobile. Not a single Indian mobile available in own Indian market.Samsung making good money with its cheap quality mobile phones.

  This is just to get your job done. don't expect too much .Pros : -** display is good.. no complains.** sound okay** can uninstall bloatware except few samsung specific ones.** very handy. form factor is nice.** Battery easily lasts for 2 days on normal** Samsung One UI is too good.Cons : -1) Camera very big disappointment. Only expect good pics in outdoors under good lighting conditions.2) Charges very slow.3) Having a tough time finding a good coverNote : No tempered glass or headphone will be provided in the box

  Not worth the price at all! I am writing the review after using 17 days!Pros.1. Handy piece tho a bit heavy it's good to operate.2. Front camera is cool.3. Good face lock AI.Cons.1. Worst camera ui and I don't think this time samsung has their quality over the camera the back camera is worst.2. Not a worthy battery life.3. Too highly priced.Totally I'm not satisfied!It's better to buy any other model other than this. If not the new realme model is of the same price almost of this and has super good features. You can choose that or any other model from Samsung itself but don't choose this model coz there are lot of flaws in this... so its not worth the price.Hope my review helped..

  Nice, does what it's supposed to do. Dual-sim works well. I use it as a backup phone to my Galaxy Note, and it works well.

  I have purchased for my mother. She is learning operating android phone 1st time. The item is handy as the screen size is smaller than ours 6"" phones.

  One of the best smartphone under 10kI bought one for my dad it works very smooth no lag or hanging issue and it's also surprise me with a gaming review I tried few heavy games and that worked really smooth camera is goodOverall I loved it in this price range thanks  Samsung and Amazon

  Samsung M series, great phone in this range all are value money. Let's see here the SAMSUNG M01 phone: red colour , thin design make gives beautiful phone look. It has optimised performance with low power consumption that's gives you longer battery life time. It does not have finger tip sensor, bought it for grand parent who do not actually need it, some time in emergency you don't wish to have these security features.  At this budget with exchange offer got a great deal a brand new phone with loaded feature at 6500, isn't good. Front camera is average, clarity is good however back dual camera is good, inbuilt animated shot can give you different experience. The phone having good voice and sound quality, inbuilt and expendable memories are now improved than older phones gives you the freedom to be entertain. I love the display quality of samsung this is unmatched feature. Phone size is small and compact so can easily carry it in pockets, or keep it with other phone if you keep two phone.If want to have phone at low budget or secondary phone for back- up with reliable brand it's a good choice.ver all it's a great quality branded value for money phone.

  This mobile was delivered on 23-Jul-2020. After 9 days of use, the volume key and power key is not working. Worst product and services by Samsung and Amazon. No option for replacement. They are distributing defective products. Please refrain from buying this mobile.

  Now this is a great phone for its price point ( under 9k )Battery is great, display is bright, speaker voice is clear ( not the loudest but works 9/10 cases ), Great UI/UX of android, average camera.There are alternatives available of this phone and you can check them out too but you won't be disappointed with this one.Things you will miss -Wifi tech is older - it won't catch the ultra fast wifi networks ( still works well with average wifi connection )Bloatware - a lot of unnecessary apps ( doesn't annoy you but still feels forced )Average camera - works fine for good daylight pics but the focus is slow and is pretty bad in low light.Old charging port - Does not use the type-c standard now and no fast charging.

  The product is good and worth for the money given. I got it for 6950 after exchanging the old Samsung.Battery life is good even after continuous use . Display and camera are very good.  No lagging.  For a middle income group it will be a good asset . No fingerprint reader.

  Poor audio quality. Ordered it for my parents but both microphone and speaker volume is poor by designInstead of having the speakers at charging jeck thay have it on the vack side. When call comes no one is able to hear because the phone is keot on its back.Despite of buying via prime fulfilled, Amazon refused to return item.

  It’s a value product by Samsung at a decent price in less than INR 10K . I personally like the screen size 5.7 better than 6.4 in other M and A series phones. Anyone can go for it! Has got a rich look ! I’m happy with my decision.

  Its a value for money product from Samsung. Though I am not a big Samsung Fan however this model is a superb option when your pocket is tight on budget and you need a good quality smartphone. Phone build quality is sturdy and gives a nice feel in hand and looks good too ,Battery life is good , camera quality is sufficient, screen is good but no fingerprint reader. I really like the screen size (5.7) which is far better that the big phones (6.+ screen size) , because of bit small screen phone fits well in hand and gives the easiness to use with single hand. Samsung should have also provided at least a wired earphone with the phone (should not cost Samsung much) which is missing in the box.

  DISPLAY: The TFT Display quality is good compared to other cheap brands, the viewing angle is also good, does not fade out much when you view it from different angle. Brightness is also sufficient.BATTERY: Battery life is very good. Hours of basic usage (online classes, calls, whatsapp, browsing) and hours of gaming. Using since 15 days, not found unnecessary battery drainage.CHARGING: It's little slow if you are used to a 10W of a fast charging mobile. 1% increment in charge takes 2 minutes and 10-15 seconds approx. But mobile does not heat at all during charging.PERFORMANCE: Zero lag during web browsing, youtube, switching between apps, online classes via skype, zoom & google meet. One UI is really very smooth. I don't play pubg, but it's easily playing games like ""IAF:A cut above"" in ultra graphic settings with no lag or frameskip.CAMERA: The major issue with this mobile is it's camera image quality in low light condition, it's very poor in low light (without flash) but with flash its ok ok type. However the back camera quality in day light or indoor light conditions is good, not soo good or bad, its just good. Selfie camera is not good at all. It needs softwere improvement.CALLS: Call quality is great and loud on both sides.CONCLUSION: If you need a compact, good looking, good in hand feel and durable non-chineese phone with basic to medium usage like online classes, low to medium intensity gaming and smooth ad-free Ui then definitely go for it. However if you want a camera centric phone taking pictures all the day and especially selfies, it's not for you.

  Very cool and decent mobile, as specification smooth touch, good processor, android 10, average camera, less SAR value,  NO heating issue at all. No back cover, no ear phone, charger not modified (old type), no fast charging. At last no signal problem, good buy for Rs 8998.

  Overall it's an average Smartphone.I would tell you about some basic parameters.PERFORMANCE- This Smartphone is having an average Processor. So, don't even think of playing heavy games like COD or PUBG. But if you are buying for normal usage than it works quite well but lags sometime as it has 3GB RAM.CAMERA- It has a decent rear camera. Depth sensor is on average and clicks normal portrait shots. Front camera is below average so don't expect much from it.BATTERY- It has 4000 mAh battery so if you have a normal usage then it works easily for 12-15 hours once it is charged 90%. One problem is that it comes with a 5V/1A Charger so it takes much time to get charged.One more thing is that it doesn't have finger print scanner.It has face unlock that works quite well.At last I would say if you want to buy a non-chinese smartphone and your budget is around 8.5k-9k then you can go for it. This phone is for moderate use and from my view it will easily work for 3-4 years. And if you want gaming or better specs then either you go for Chinese phones or make your budget large.

  My Personal genuine reviewSamsung Is overcharged for this phone, the brand which most people love in india.Samsung is Overpriced his every Phone in india, using anti China sentiment of Indian people.If you buy this phone remember it will take total 4 Hours to charge Fully??.Charger is only 5v 1amp.Samsung price 8.5k for this phone and doesn't even satisfy now days criteria.Camera is also Bakwas??.Resolution quality really you will hate after using because I think it's 480ppi Resolution. Because also have mother HD+ phone which is more clear than this m01.Performance is also not upto the mark.All disadvantages in it.But there is Only one advantage if you also antichina then you get 'Samsung' only 'name' from non Chinese brand.That's only advantage ??Buy if you want to let samsung use anti china sentiment and let samsung earn more money via overpriced.

  Like : Right now fast access, feather touch key, good camera and picture quality, excellent customer care and remote access of the phone.Dislike: Some important feature like 'Screenshot' is absent in scroll up menu that is to be brought from Accesibility option of setting and put on Assistant menu. Which should be a ready option in scroll up menus. Incoming phone call sound quality was very poor however that was resolved by guidance from Customer care by remote accessing.Battery life which needs to be more longer.

  Post 3 days of usage :Battery - Excellent battery backup (goes up to 2nd day effortlessly - gaming not included in usage).Charging - Fast charging is a miss vs competition brands but while using the device didnt feel it as missing since device sustains entire day smoothly so no probs.Built - Plastic built but from the looks alone it feels good (have a red one) not premium though.The size of the device makes it a superb grip and ease of use with single hand.Display & Touch - Display is small vs  competition. Colour/Brightness is decent enough; no complaints at all. Touch is buttery smooth.OS - Android 10 (though not stock android like Nokia) advantage against competition; very few devices below 10K giving Android10 as out of the box. One would experience it during daily usage.Camera - Worst of the lot i guess; shaky, noisy images and videos (rear and front both) .. it was a shock - Samsung should do something about it in the next s/w update.Except Camera rest the device is very good at the price point!

  The phone is Samsung's offer for those who want a budget phone within 10K. In these Covid times, every person wants a smartphone, but there are not many options, what with many persons not wanting to buy Chinese products. This phone is the answer to them. It has all the features a decent smartphone offers, and is not too heavy on the pocket. I sincerely endorse this product and ask fellow persons to try this.

  Phone is good as per this price range with samsung brand value but i have more more expectations

"
  I am using this phone for more than a week now. I'll try to lay down the pros and cons.Pros:-* Perfect size, best for single hand use and also good enough for watching films and videos.* Battery life is decent, with moderate to slightly heavy usage it easily lasts for a day or more.* Android 10 from the box.* With3gb/32g it functions quite smoothly. No lags whatsoever.* The speaker sound is loud enough and clear.Cons:-* No fingerprint scanner, the face unlock doesn't work well. So you need to depend on pattern or pin unlock.* Doesn't support fast charging, takes around 3.5 hrs for full charge.Some othe points :-* The camera is definitely not the best in the budget but is ok considering the price point.* display isn't amoled but its again decent enough for the price.Finally i would definitely recommend this phone to the ones who are searching for phones in the budget segment with the brand assurance of Samsung and a single hand usable device.

  This phone is meant for a very small group of people. First of all, it is a very small display compared to other flagship or even other low budget phone . The only reason one should buy this is either they love Samsung ui - android 10 or they need a backup phone with very less radiation. The snapdragon 400 chip set is a very outdated chip which does not provide even close to the performance from other phones from this range. Well , after this you might think that the camera might be great. Wrong again , the 8 mega pixel camera can maximum take photos uptown 4 mp(which is not of even good quality either) and the front facing camera is just trash.Talking about spec sheet, out the the 32 GB, you only get 20. And out 3GB ram , there is only 1.5 GB ram which you can use. Running simple applications take about 2.5 GB ram.Battery is decent(finally something good about the phone) but it will ofcourse be so ,as there has been compromises is every other part of the phone.  In the box comes a 5 watt charger which takes ages. At an age where phones can charge uptown 100 watt, it's totally unfair that samsung gives us 5 watt charger. There is no inbuilt screen protector or back case.The dual camera setup is just for name sake. Please don't buy this phone for the camera or performance.Like I said earlier,  this phone is useful for old grandparents or children with limited usage. With is budget,  you can get better phones such as narzo 10a or oppo phones which are better and give relatively good performance too.The phone doesn't lag much but due to the small screen , online class or videos will be hard to attend. If in case you plan to buy this phone , try contacting a physical store as they can give you a better price. Another problem I noticed, the charging cable is smaller than the normal size. Makes it difficult to charge.

  Superrrrb Phone if u are looking for a backup phone for unlimited phone calls and browsing and watching Videos/Live TV.The phone doesnt have a finger print reader but has face recognition option. Face recognition works very well.I bought this one to give my Google Pixel3 a backup ... A backup friend... For my office SIM... as my office calls are endless....morning 9 to evening 8...The best thing about this phone is its size..i wanted small sized screen phone and also light weight ...so i can use it without headphones/earphones..Great Phone in this price range.Battery life is excellent.I am using this phone since last week and found no issues till yet.I am happy to go again with samsung..after a decade.. M01... is a must buy phone ..Trust me... If my wife losses her iphone again..I will gift her M01 in an iphone case??...Samsung again makes me brand loyal to him..

  you have lots of options available in that prize, I have order because there was a Replacement guarantee but its only if the phone has fault with it, if you dont like the phone on Design or features you cant change!

  Good budget phone for common people.Overall the phone looks good , at this price 3 gb ram and 32gb space is at best price available. I bought these phone after comparing each model available with 3gb,32gb combination.Features:Value for Money.3GB ram and 32 GB space good enough for daily use.Samsung brand is good as compared to chines phone.Touch sensitivity is good.Not too big in size . can be handled with one hand..Drawbacks:Battery life is okay not great.

  Build quality is really good. I like Samsung Glance app showing news on our interests in the lock screen. My old phone had fingerprint sensor which is missing in M01 but face lock and unlock does the trick and works well. Likewise, I used android one UI in earlier phone. The only feature that i miss is swipe left from home screen to get Google news feed. But then again, its a software feature. My earlier phone was a 16K costing one and still it lasted only 1.5 years and i learnt that since the hynix eMMC used in device hit its lifetime, writes started failing and so phone became unusable. So, I wanted to buy Samsung this time as Samsung eMMC would be more reliable and would last longer. Snapdragon 439 SoC processor is just right enough for regular phone use. Camera still pictures would look super good provided person holds the phone still and even after clicking needs to hold the phone still for couple of seconds or else, the pic appears distorted. Would recommend this phone for sure as it is sturdy and very good value for money.

  No finger printer reader. A handy phone thats of perfect size. Camera is of poor quality  ,doesnt give the 13mp result . Takes more than 3hrs for charging.The product is good when delivered, no faulty packaging or anything as told in other reviews. The charger too gets heated fast. The phone started lagging even aftr the first hour of use(just a 2sec lagged..like it was frozen),then came back.Overall for this Rs 8k its the perfect phoneand better than using any chinese phones.

  No finger print option and phone size would have been 6 inch+.  Now a days competitors supplying the mobiles of matching quality with specified features around same price. In order to retain the existing premier position commanding in mobile segment, hope Samsung focus much to bridge such gaps. Overall it's  a nice experience with this mobile  so far and found to be a good value for money in budget phone segment , for this hard core Motorola user since beginning who opted this  mainly due to its OS with latest android version 10 which enables to  access his company applications supporting only with android 10 and above since 1st October 2020.

  Hi All,Please don’t buy this product as this model hang always.  I got this model and used only for 5 days after that suddenly it got dead. when i put in to charge for more that 30 minutes also it didn’t get start. Post contact to samsung support suggested to press both power & lower volume button to start but still it stuck on home screen. You can see the image. Finally Amazon denied for replacement also even after 6 days. i am sure defect in this model so guys request you please don’t buy this product. its my pathetic experience on amazon & on this model.

  I bought this for my aunt. Performance is good actually. I’ve put lots of apps and the speed was good. Speaker is not that loud but for the price it is good. Camera is bad but for people not wanting it, it gets the job done! I’ve also bought M01 core (2GB) which is way inferior compared to this. M01 core’s camera is worse than this. For people using only Facebook, Whatsapp... M01 core would be fine but for a price difference of only ?1900; M01 offers a lot more!

  This phone is so under rated. Got it for ?8400 and I guess I didn't made a mistake.I don't usually play games  so its probably the best non chinese phone. Best for daily use. Battery backup lasts for a day with heavy social media use and light gaming.  Even played COD mobile and PUBG on low settings and the game play was fine.  Charging takes around 4 hours with the in box 5w charger, but can be charged with a 10W charger. Overall a good product where my privacy isn't jeopardized.

  I was searching for a handy smartphone for long time. I found this realesed recently and purchased. Everything fine, if Samsung included  fingerprint scanner, this one is the best small form factory  smartphone ever. If you ready to enter every time password or pattern to unlock (with face masks unlocking with face recognition is not possible) go for it. Otherwise find something with fingerprint unlock.

  Reviewing the device after using it for more than a week. Find my pros and cons below:Pros:1. Battery: Battery backup is super impressive if you are a normal user. I don't play games but have to take calls through the day as I am working from home and I also use its hotspot throughout the day and the battery doesn't disappoint.2. Camera - I know that this is the new age of triple and quad camera setups in mobile phone but I have to say that even though I had very less expectations from the camera it does a wonderful job. The samsung camera app is superb and even though it has limited features it still performs fabulously in daylight and nicely in artificial or low light.3. One UI- The Samsung's very own android skin is amazingly cool and makes the user experience so much better.4. Display- Even though this is an LCD display still the colours are punchy and even in sunlight the display performs well.5. Biometric- The face unlock performs nicely and unlocks the device in a jiffy.You will not regret the absence of a fingerprint sensor.Cons:1. Charger: As it is a 4000 mAh battery the absence of a fast charger is something that hurts. They could have included the 15 watt adapter that they offer with other devices.2. Case: Though not really a necessity, presence of a protective case would have been so much better.There aren't too many cons as this is a really good device for normal usage and you would be able to use it for all your essential needs for day to day basis.

  Very economical, an excellent phone for this budget.PROS...Since it is Android 10, we can apply dark mode and hence battery consumption is less.Also, even latest apps can be installed in this smartphone due to android 10.3GB Ram provides an excellent working condition to this phone. Even Pubg can be played in this phone without any sort of hang.Massive screen with infinity V display helps to see the online classes and movies very clearly.Dolby atmos provides an excellent utility to this phone. Even with a worthless earbud, by using Dolby atmos, it sounds good.It has a huge battery of 4000mAh and also massive  storage of 32 gb ram, which is worthy for a normal user.LAST but NOT LEAST, I'm very happy to hear that this is an INDIAN smartphone designed by INDIANS. Make in IndiaCONS...Even it has an octa core processor, its processor is very low when compared to redmi and realme phones in this price range.It does not have a fingerprint scanner, but has a fast face unlock.Even though it has a huge battery, it has a 2hrs charging time.So although it has some cons, it is a smartphone with many pros and some cons. I like it very much.What about you ???

  Awesome mobile phone and I bought from Amazon I got in one day delivery . the mobile everything is good to buy but taking more time to full battery.

  The phone is very good, i bought it for my dad because he wanted a small size phone and this was the best ideal size to handle with one hand. I love the software that is latest and smooth. You can watch the video on Tech blast Youtube channel. Samsung cameras are always the best and this is the perfect one for the price. Battery is ever lasting. It works for my dad for 2 days. Just the charger is very slow and no fast charger support, hope to get in any future OTA update.

  Bought this one on 25th August, reviewing on 22nd September.Battery life with a pocket friendly size is the only good thing about this phone! The headphone jack is behaving so erratically...it automatically reduces or increase the volume of audio/video being played and despite pressing hard on the keys or trying different earphones, the problem persists...even after a factory reset.Also, the charging socket has stopped working properly, so now I have to place my phone at a specific angle or keep holding in my hands in that position while charging the phone!Screw you Amazon...7 days replacement policy is just not good enough!

  Well its my third Smartphone and all are Samsung. Reason is quite obivious it seals the deal everytime with everything under one roof. So reviewing it after 3 weeks of hardcore usage.Pros:1. Great performance. Processing power is quite good, even frame rate syncing seems good.2. Battery Life is awesome3. Stunning Design (Red colour looks damn sexy)4. Value for Money5. Thin Body great benefit for the one's like me who use the smartphone with one hand.Cons:1. Camera seems a bit average due to over bright and filtered pictures. I loved the old cameras by Samsung which had touch of originality. Capturing even the wrinkes and imperfections on your face. Please bring those back2. No Fingerprint Sensor.Overall a smart buy with tight budget.

  This phone is another value for money product from the house of Samsung. The following are the things why I like and dislike about  the product:-Pros:1.Battery Life- with 4000mah battery the the battery is powerful for day long intensive use.2. Display-with 5.7 infinity display, the screen the best you can get at this price range.3.Processor- with snapdragon octa core processor the phone is perfect for multi window functions and moderate gaming.4.Android: comes with the latest version of Android 10.5.Memory - comes with 3 gb ram and and 32 gb internal memory with sd card support upto 512 gb which is really good.6. The dark comes looks really cool to me.7. Shape is really nice as it sticks to your palm giving you comfort and I-phone kind of a feeling.Cons:Camera- I must say Samsung fails in a certain way when it comes to camera .Chinese brands are way ahead in this criteria. This is the only thing where Samsung misses out.Overall I give a double thumbs up to this device apart from camera.This is THE PRODUCT product to buy in this  price range if you want to avoid non-chinese product.Also not forget the good after sales service you get from Samsung,they have service centres all over India.

  Galaxy M01 comes with pre installed Android 10, which means the user shall have state of the art privacy and security features. Additionally, Samsung's One UI Core 2.0 provides simple user interface which is seamless and attractive.I have been using this phone from last 10 days and faced no issues. All the features are reliable and easy to use.Talking about battery, since I do not use social media and gaming, battery for me lasts for about 2 days after one full charge.You can also hide the navigation keys from the screen and still navigation will be seamless.Another best feature is that you can disable the pre installed Google apps on this phone if you are too concerned about Google collecting your personal data.I haven't used the camera much, so I cannot give review for the camera, but bear in mind that it comes with depth effect.Just one improvement the manufacturers could have maintained is not placing the speakers on the rear panel. The sound doesn't plays clearly when phone is placed on soft surfaces like bed. Some users might not like it.Overall, I find this phone excellent for myself. So, I give it 5 stars.

  I bought this phone for just one reason that it is a non chinese brand. Lets talk about some pros and cons of this M01  smartphone.Pros :BEST THING WITH THIS PHONE IS THAT IT IS HANDY. IT FITS IN YOUR HAND SO WELL. ALSO ITS SCREEN SIZE IS SMALLER THAN THOSE BIG SMARTPHONES.TILL NOW THERE IS NO LAG ISSUE.VERY LESS HEATING ISSUE.CAMERA IS BIT REALISTIC.MULTI TASKING IS SMOOTH.DISPLAY IS SUPER IN THIS PRICE RANGE.PLACEMENT OF POWER BUTTONS AND VOLUME KEYS  ARE SOMETHING IMPRESSIVE.ANDROID 10CONS :AGAIN SCREEN SIZE. AS NOWADAYS EVEN 5K SMARTPHONES HAVE  6+"" SCREEN.CHARGING IS A BIG ISSUE AS IT COMES WITH A 10V CHARGER. IT TAKES AROUND 3:30hrs FOR FULL CHARGE.BATTERY SIZE IS ALSO A ISSUE AS IT COMES WITH A 4000mah BATTERYMEDIA VOLUME COULD HAVE BEEN MORE LOUDER.AND MOST IMPORTANT IT COMES WITH SOME BANNED PRE INSTALLED APPS. IDK WHY THESE PEOPLE GIVE THESE THINGS IN A NEW PHONES.

  Phone is good at this price range with Samsung branding.Good thingBattery life very good with calling and data usageDisplay is bright enough in outdoor no issue with auto brightnessSound is clear for speakers as well as earpiece.Camera quality is ok for this price range.

  Samsung is just not able to deliver the quality the customer expect from it.There nothing good about this phone,Its slow, hangs if you download a few apps, even its not able to support half the capacity other phone of this range/memory/RAM can support.In just 30 days of delivery the phone showed a display problem, and when I visited their service centre, they said it will take at least 4 days to fix the display issue. Which I believe, if done outside wouldn't take more then 10 mins. And as per them you have to leave your phone with them for these 4-5 days when they will be ordering and arranging the display. As if you bought the phone for ur baby to play video games and you dont have any important needs from your smart phone.

  Got a defective set, where calls keep dropping after few minutes. Doesn't Samsung do a quality check on its products, they sell defective sets. This does not have a fingerprint reader as mentioned. Not going to buy Samsung anymore, shifting to redmi.Reported it to Amazon, had a good customer service experience and they refunded the amount.

  HiThis Samsung M01 is such  handy phone build Samsung ever.  The design of the phone Is stunning and there are no chance of slipping from hand .And people like me always looks for the phone which is handy with tons of feature .This display fluidity is awesome and there is no lag in playing games either.People who leads their life simple and subtle will like this phone .To mention few  addon would make this phone better .B1.Box speaker would be better2.Aluminum frame would give this model richer look instead.3. Updated chipset with more memory and with same harwarebuild will make this phone hurricane in entire smartphone market.At last expecting compact phone with tons of feature loaded .Thanks

  This phone would be awesome if it's price were 6000 0r 7000 but it's price is 9000.9000 rs and still no type c charger.9000 rs and still no fast charging.9000 and still no fingerprint sensor.9000 rs and still pathetic speaker(sound is very low and clarity too is patetic)that too on the back. no phone nowadays have speaker at back.9000 rs and phone looks cheap(bad plastic material is used)in 9000 rs u would get far better mobile than this mobile.if the price would be 6 k or 7k ,i would say phone is good.but in 9000 here we r getting undervaluer mobile with no fingerprint sensor,pathetic speaker ,no type c charger,cheap lookSamsung have fooled their customers.

  This phone is suitable if one's requirement is of a basic smartphone which is affordable, durable and comes handy.I am satisfied with the phone for the very same purpose that I mentioned above.The UI is quick and smooth, display quality is excellent and battery life is good.The only drawback I found for this category of phone is the camera quality which could have been better, but no qualms about it.Any other high end expectations would be defeated. After all it's a Samsung brand that speaks for itself.

  1. Overall feel good.2. Lags a bit but not that much that too sometimes, may be it will settle with time3. Fingerprint Scanner should have been included, that's bad not to have.4. While charging they should provide a indicator light on top of screen, every time have to click the button/unlock to check5. Vibration while touching menu/Back buttons at bottom can't be disabled6. Sound and Camera is Good7. Battery charging and daily life not that good but what more to expect in this budget.8. take it if your budget is low. its a good  Phone but dnt expect much
",,
"
  This  phone is very convenient to use. 3 GB ram ensures it will not lag.32 g b memory is also sufficient. Photos are good  and  images are sharp and bright.
",,
"
  Despite having 3GB ram it's pretty fast and impressive. Can use multiple apps at the same time. Battery life is superb, easily lasts for a day. Sometimes even more depends on the usage. Not meant for playing high end games though. If you are looking for a smartphone for your routine office work and other stuffs go for it but if for playing games you have to spend a bit more. Charging it takes almost 2 to 2.5 hours which is acceptable considering it's not typeC. If it had type C charger then it could have been a game changer for Samsung.I am really happy with my M01????

  Hi,I purchased it for my Father.1) Good average phone.2) Better alternative for Chinese mobile even it was lag in some features.3) Battery is working for more than 36 Hrs after moderate usage.4) Butter smooth operations.5) Comes with Android 10. Hope regular updates will be available.6) Camera is decent.7) Sounds are clear8) Display is responsive9) Handy10) Missing fast charging11) Missing Finger print security12) Comes Office tools13) Suggest: Power n Volume button should be in same side ( Now frequent screen shots capturing without knowledge)Overall ""VALUE FOR MONEY"".

  This is an example of product made in India and made for India. Bought this product for my father. Battery life and performance is really good. Just a bit disappointed with camera quality. Somehow I felt that this product is bit overpriced. Samsung could have packed a headphone or backcover with this product. If you want to gift this phone to your parents or children I would suggest you must buy it. Moreover you can trust the samsung apllications. Hope this review helps :) Happy shopping with Amazon delivery was really fast. The pricing policy was also very strategic.Thank you Amazon. Thank you Samsung.

  Now don't buy any product from Amazon. They have changed their policy. Now they dont return items. They will only replace weather you are satisfied with the product or not. So now be aware. I am not satisfied with this M 01 phone so i want return but Amazon is not agree for return.

  Writing this review after more then week of usage, One of the best mobile at this prices. Got it for 4099/- after a exchange of my old mobile for 4400/-.* Battery was strong enough continuously used for entire day  Facebook, WhatsApp, video and calls. Takes two hours to charge 100% but will remain for two days to totally drain out.* Display was awesome and looks great with the stylish edge finish* Camera was great especially front great to take selfies.*Processor performing very well.After a month of  searching  got a great one with the for better price....

  Samsung is known for their eccentric and long lasting product.  This phone is no exception. Although in a sub 10k segment, samsung doesn't offer much, compared to it's market rivals. But surely this phone can be a good example of balance between budget and components.It definitely has good battery life, although it's quite new.  user interface is quite simple and easyto use. really low spec phone, meant for casual use. Camera however is bit overwhelming, has a absurd auto HDR mode, which results in very bad portraits.overall, it's  good phone for everyday casual use'

  This phone i bought it for my dad. Initially I was satisfied with this Samsung phone at this price level. In this Corona times, my dad went 5 times to Airtel showroom.  Changed Airtel Chennai SIM 3 times but Call drop issues did not get resolved.  Left with no other option, I bought Chinese phone with exchange option of 20 days used this Samsung Phone. I am disappointed with loss of money due to resale.We live near Chennai Airport (within proper city limits).Not recommend bcoz of Call drop issues.

  In the world of smartphones, where all brands have started manufacturing mobile sizes from 6.5 inches to 7 inches which are like tablets, M01 is fresh breath. Just when I needed a much needed spare mobile which is non Chinese, with basic features and average RAM, ROM, good battery, M01 solved my purpose. Perfectly sized for my hand and pocket, 3GB,32GB is absolutely matching my expectations.Being a basic handset, I don't expect good camera and fingerprint is not thereAmazon delivery has been before scheduled time as always.

  I was shocked that there is. I finger print sensor available in this phone. Along with that the speakers (ear ,outer) are not audible enough even in a calm environment. When the basic features of a smart phone are lacking in this phone, does is makes sense to buy this phone?No.If there is a no return policy exists on the amazon purchase, I bet the no becomes a big NO.
",,
"
  No fingerprint reader, battery life  is satisfactory, once charged  it goes for about 1 to 1.5 days depending on use. User friendly interface but if you're using Samsung for the first time it will take sometime to get used to it as compared to Xiomi and Huawei phones.Also, few android features are missing like it doesn't show network speed, doesn't have additional volume button for only alarm setting and no separate tab for headphone advance settings. Other features , sound and camera is great. Handy and smooth running.

  We have purchaged this phone on 18 th Aug. and It is too early to share expert comments but can share our feeling towards phone, it looks very compact n user friendly as compared to my other phones. Battery life also very good. Very good looking a handy for normal users, never found any laging or any difficulties during usage. Lots of good and very useful features found in all segments of the phone. It provides you fresh n wow  feeling while  usage. Overall we can say more than worth to buy this phone in this price tag.

  A basic phone by samsung. Camera quality is not good specially at night. I bought this phone for my father. So it's ok for him.

  It's a horrible phone. Moreover to resolve the issue when spoken to Amazon representative he was horribly dum and he not even listened the problem to resolve. He simply denied to help to resolve. Even before replacing he advised to install app to check whether I m lying.Representative of Amazon was so noncoperative and insensitive. I decided not to purchase anything on this cheat app. Horrible experience on Amazon. If this can happen to a well educated person then what about a layman.

  Over all the look of the mobile is so simple, it doesn't seema catchy at all. Display experience is also not as good as you find in it's previous mid range mobiles like on5 and on7 pro. You also didn't find this much good for extremely good picture. But they quite satisfactory. So here I guess you are only paying for battery, storage, prosessor sort of dual camera features and infinity display and most importantly the SAMSUNG brand.

  This phone is great. Good value for money and also it can be used roughly. The phone is very responsive and easy to use. But the face id is not that good. It doesn't recognize the face sometimes. But for the price, it's worth it. Also the back camera is quite clear. One more point to add, there is no sensor next to front camera. The sensor by which we can hear the whatsapp audio when we bring the phone to our ear. Overall, great phons for the price.

  Good phone in the price range of less than 10000. Handy phone with super stylish look and the blue color one is more attractive. Good phone for a minimal usage person who use phone for calls messages whatsapp google and camera.

  Some drawbacks on this phone - 1. Poor hardware causing more radiation. I already have burning sensation and numbness on my fingers and palm. 2. The phone is a heavy weight one, compared to other phones of the same segment. Thickness of the phone is just too much! 3. Display is narrow ( it may be preferred by people who like a little smaller phone). 4. Touch screen doesn't have a standard response effect, not that smooth.

  Good phone under Rs.9000/- budget. Received on 21.08.2020 on exchange of my J7 nxt. Apps run smoothly. Very handy with 5.7 inch screen as the borders are very close to screen. Camera is good as per price. Battery is decent as 50% power remains till night with moderate use(calls & games, browsing). It has Qualcomm processors hence heating is very less likely.No finger reader.

  3gb and 32gb is worth for money for Samsung brand though u get cheaper in other brandHowever I am totally disappointed with Samsung M01 on the bluelight feature as it is not at all effective and harm our eyes and I am thinking to return this product as I don't want to compromise with eyes whatever brand and configuration.Hope Samsung here my concerns and help

  This mobile is one that can be rated as average but at this price range, it's a good buy. Additionally, it comes with the assurance of the Samsung brand.

  Awesome Amazon service..i bought in amazon prime within 24 hours I got delivery my mobile.its superb fast service and brand new Samsung M01 . Superb display and camera ?? battery charger.. overall mobile 4.3/5Packing of amazon is wonderful.

  Amazon have given description that mobile contains fingerprint scanner but we was shocked that the phone was without fingerprint scanner.Other Companies provide fingerprint scanner in similar segments.Not satisfied with this phone at a price of Rs.8400Faceunlock of this phone is of very poor quality.

"
  The processor works well andcthe camera is handy atvthe given price. Thecsleek finish looks similar to other prime phones available in the market. Overall it's a good one to carry at this price of 9k

"
  The only negative point of M01 is not having a fingerprint reader,besides that the camera quality is not bad at all,the ""battery life"" is also quite good.in this price range the Samsung  M01 is truely a quite good smart phone.So go for it without hesitation.

"
  Awesome mobile at this price range.Recommended for light users
",,
"
  Good non Chinese option at this price. Camera is very poor both front and back. Yes, battery takes 3-4 hrs to get fully charged from zero. Presence of notification light and fingerprint sensor would have make this phone a very good option. But overall good option for the people who don't want to play around with this phone.

"
  worst mobile phone in this price, very very badly hanging issue in this mobile, also touch is not smooth, camera quality is very very bad
",,
"
  This phone doesn't have a fingerprint sensor. The battery is very good - with a normal use, after full day the  battery still shows 80% remaining.Speaker volume is not good should have been a little louder. That is why 3 stars. Otherwise would have given 5 stars to this phone at this price.

"
  This product is not good, feature are very less, and amazon not provide return or reffund policy, they are not considered the customers satisfaction.They are looking for business only,forcelly added mobiles to customers

  Samsung m01 is handy and easy to use with one. I gifted this to my mother. The camera quality is good for this price. For a normal user i thing this phone is ok.Cons:Face id is slight lag in low lightFingerprint sensor is absentBut i like the product for this budgetI think this review can help others.

  I was planning to buy any phone available in lowest possible range with basic features. This model was already bestseller and it costed even less than my target budget. Functions great, I charge it after more than a day.It doesn't have fingerprint lock, call recording option and its own music player. Rest everything is very convenient and handy.

  Received faulty mobile. Mobile takes 8 hours to fully charge. Can someone advise what to do?I don't know what to do. Expect Amazon to help with this.

  I've purchased two phone and both phone has performance issue. Sometimes unable to pickup the call and also sometimes phone is hanged.I've requested for return of this phone but amazon guy's are saying issue will be resolved after OS update. So I tried to update the OS and also tried factory reset option but is still there.

  Sleek yet robust! was using a Chinese brand earlier and found this one in exchange. best is the battery life, I am using since last month and a half now but one charge and it's enough for me for a full busy WFH day.  Camera and other performance are of the right choices for me. Overall a good deal under 7k for me.

  Its too early to give the review.Finger print feature is not given :(However overall product seems good for now but we noticed that call was getting disconnected every 2 mins but however this problem seems to be solved after software update. Other features are looking good and functional.

  This is pathetic mobile if you think, it has good performance rating in case of battery life. I will give 0 out of 10. Battery never charges easily.Battery is the soul of mobile, if it's drains out or not charges fast.. it worst to buy...Not recommendedThanksAbhijeet

  I have purchased Samsung Galaxy M01 and this mobile is simply Awesome and worthy.  The battery performance is good and for me it's one and half day, coming to camera there are many options to take a beautiful picture, in this price this dual camera is fine.  Ultimately, I am satisfied with Samsung.

  No finger print reader, good product for ealder people, College students with all basic features included - good camera, touch - can easily fit in pockets and purses- definitely recommend to buy

  Phone is ok but having some problems like caller could not hear my voice and sometimes display related problems.Although they have provided replacement but they would not replace instead they would suggest some app checkups that would say your phone is alright.

  Check after you get the ptoduct. I ordered this phone a got a defective one, it's sim card was not ejecting. I ordered to return they took 7 days to complete that process. But got my money back very soon. The phone is good compared to  chineese toy phones. Has a good built up quality and good for aged people.

  Always been a samsung fan so I was sure while choosing this phone. User interface is very good. In day light it captures very good pictures.  Battery life is quite good. Easily go for 1 day in one charge and if internet is not used than almost 1 and half day. Just wish speaker was a bit louder.
",,
"
  Speaker stopped working in one day.Bad customer service from amazon representative when asked about can 1 day exception as the phone was for old person and she took time to understand the amazon representative talked in very rude tone indirectly telling that amazon is  doing a favor on us but not customer service

"
  1st we received damaged phone, which we returned [after lot of effort] 2nd phone was also not working , amazon assigned engineer who came and fix the issue but the product is not worth spending money.Honestly we wanted to return but it can only be replaced and not returned.

  This mobile phone speaker are not working and when i am submitting to return this mobile they are saying to first download some app and verify that your phone is defective and after that we will see. i just want that product exchange then why i have to test that defective piece?

  Overall its good, for whom the smartphone is required for only social media...fb, wtsup, youtube, and some daily usage..The calling sound of the phone is very very low, u can't hear the other person in speker even, internet connection gets cut while talking in normal call, its too old system they have given...

  Good phone in this price range. If you have problems with buying a costly phone, just go for it. Please don't blindly believe in all the reviews which say battery isn't good and camera isn't good. They are decent enough. And it is also smoother than my other phone having 4GB RAM. Just GO FOR IT!

  Length  and breadth ratio is not at all good. This is having very serious defact if you are making audio call through WhatsApp then the screen should be always on otherwise you can't hear voice.  Now on Amazon no return policy for many things only replacement

  it was a good device but sometimes face unlock doesn't respond. only one face can be registered at a time for face unlock. its a disadvantage. performance wise it was good for day to day usage.

  I think you should not buy this phone because you can get a good one by spending 1500-2000 rupees, not a good display , not a fingerprint reader,unable to take long screenshots, despite this all it's a budget and good battery life.I'm unable to return it because of sellers TnC,i want to buy another one .

  Samsung did it again. Galaxy M01 is a mid segment and budget friendly phone for a brand lovers and first time smartphone users. This is non chinese phone and branded and  atleast buyers can have a good piece of mind.

  Awesome budget smartphone with wide range of features. I bought it for my Mother and she loved  M01 very much.The display is amazing with color contrast. Battery life is very good and long lasting. Multiple applications are supported by the robust processor. Overall a must buy smartphone.

  Have been using it for the last few weeks, so far its quite a good purchase! Great phone for the price point, however, would have been better with a larger screen size. Since I am avoiding Chinese companies, this was my final choice. It would become a default choice if a larger screen was provided.

  They say that this phone doesn't have a good battery life and not latest fast charging like those of Vivo or XIAMI but it is still great. I have experienced that it gets fully charged within 3hrs which ia good for students like us. The reason to like and buy it is simply that it is Samsung's product.

  The phone is extremely handy and small in size. Fits best in pocket. I feel Samsung should bring out smartphones with same screen size with enhanced memory and features such as AMOLED display and better camera. We are bored of carrying bigger phones. Samsung can really think about this.

  This is my personal view n review.  I upgraded from ayear old Redmi note 7 pro to M31 s because i wanted a non Chinese phone & m31s promo claimed good camera  battery etc. After usage of a week, I am sure that this was a bad decision. This phone is overhyped n priced. 15k would have been the right price for it. Its camera is good but doesn't give you out of the world experience.  Battery is 6K but doesnt run even for 1.5 day under normal use. Plastic used on backcover is cheap, the Samsung chipset sucks, this phone should have come with snapdragon and in range of 15K. I am not liking to write this review but Samsung has disappointed again. Redmi or one plus phones are clear winners. I will return this phone.

Fingerprint scanner on side is very Fast8. Gradient look is nice...Cons :1. Chipset still Exynos 9611 (10nm).

  I am writing this review after 3 days of moderate to heavy usage.Design: The design of the phone is stunning even though its made of glasstic. The back is a dust and fingerprint magnet. So suggest to use a case. 5/5.Battery: Monstrous. Lasted for a day after watching 2 movies, occasional checking of mails, light gaming and browsing social media. I still had 10% left. The highlight is of course reverse charging and the super fast charging support. Took around 100 to 120 mins to charge the phone completely from 0 to 100. 5/5.Camera: One of the best if not the best camera in this range. The Sony sensor does a great job in the imaging department with some intelli cam features. 4.5/5.Processor and UI: For the last 3 days, that I've been using this phone, UI was pretty smooth and with some bloatware. I am a stock android lover, so thankfully I was able to delete a few pre-installed apps and block the ads/app recommendations while setting up the phone. There are some cool features like smart pop up view which are really awesome. The processor was lag free and its performance was smooth. I don't want to comment on gaming as I am not a heavy gamer. Overall an great choice for day to day usage. 4.5/5.Display: No comments. Just 5/5.The only disappointment I had was there was no case provided in the box. Overall I would give 5/5 for this phone. Regarding the pricing, when I've compared it with the competitors for 6/128 gb variants there was a difference of 1k to 1500 which I felt was fine considering the Samsung brand and features offered.I would recommend this one if anyone is looking for a decent phone under 20k.

  Though not a big samsung fan I purchased Samsung M31S immediately after India launch yesterday for 18K after HDFC discount for 6/128GB after waiting for nearly 2 months for Redmi note 9 pro max 6/128 which was at 17K then went to 18.5K due to tax and production issues coz of lockdown. It was impossible to buy in their weekly flash sales coz Redmi didn’t have enough stock.Out of frustration thought of buying Samsung M31 6/128 which was available at 16K then but the Exynos processor, old dewdrop front cam, rear fingerprint scanner and 15watt charger for 6K battery holded me back…My Lenovo P2 which I had purchased on launch day in Jan 2017 had speaker issues after 3.5 years of usage.. Service centre has closed down in my city and nowhere else speaker was available…but after Redmi stock issues and M31 shortcomings made me purchase speaker for P2 from amazon and still using the phone. Repaired a phone for the first time in my life. Lenovo P2 is most underrated phone. Best battery life ever. Even after 3.5 years I still get 9 to 10 hrs of screen time. Excellent.I have used samsung only once earlier….Note 3 Neo….gud phone intially but later started hanging and pathetic battery life…. So my main expectation after using Lenovo P2s huge 5100mah battery from 3.5 yrs was battery life as I am a heavy user though I never play games.Though M31s processor may not be great for gaming etc it’s gud for normal usage. All my other concerns of M31 were overcome by M31s like punch hole camera, side fingerprint, 25 w charger, attractive design with side frame etc. Also Sony IMX 682 sensor and new camera features were add on.Also in Amazon sale got it for just 500 more than M31 and 500 less than Redmi note 9 pro max during normal sale when I intended to buy 2 monthsago… (6/128 model)I had also considered Poco X2 coz of its camera but was put off by its 4500 mah battery. Many users had issues of battery drain also. But if I had purchased Redmi note 9 pro max, Poco X2 or even Motorola one fusion plus or Realme 6 I would have deeply missed my Lenovo P2s super amoled display…..All these chinese brand phones though have gud Snapdragon processors but have very poor IPS display which r no match to super amoled display. I have seen and compared few IPS display phones with family and friends with my Lenovo P2 super amoled display…..there is day and night difference….So if I had gone with Redmi note 9 pro max I would have missed super amoled display and sony sensor…in samsung m31s I will miss Snapdragon processor…btw my 3.5 yrs old Lenovo P2 is having Snapdragon 625….Its super power efficient and smooth for day today tasks and heavy multi tasking..never played any games though....hope Exynos processor will atleast match S625 if not more.I ordered it on 6th Aug around 12.15 am…. was delivered on 8th Aug…..first impression is very gud especially the camera… excellent super amoled display….even a lot better than my Lenovo P2 super amoled display….built quality is the best in M series with new stylish dual colours and also has a side frame….but can’t b compared to glass backs which r just awesome but very fragile in reality….. anyways how many of us use mobile without case…..so this shall not make any impact for potential buyers of M31S…......case is must for M31s coz back though looks like glass is plastic and will easily get scratches.Battery is also excellent....being a Lenovo P2 user for 3.5 yrs I think finally I got a gud successor for it. Can't really tell the battery screen on time coz I am installing my 100 plus apps and logging in. Today charged from 21% to 100% in 1.36 hrs....so from 0 to 100 it might take 1.55 hrs to max 2 hrs...huge important over M31 which had same battery but would take 2.45 hrs to fully charge.Fingerprint is gud….it's fast but u need to touch it correctly….but I am getting used to side mounted fingerprint…it will take some time as I had front (below the display) fingerprint in my Lenovo P2.Rear camera is excellent. I am still checking out its features. Intelli cam with single take is quite interesting and helpful during important private moments.Indoor selfies r excellent provided there is enough artificial light…. without much light it’s avg like any other mid range phone….if we use front flash (white screen) when lighting is less then photo come very sharp and gud but with little boosted colours like wat normally redmi and realme back cameras do….I am not a gamer…..for normal apps and multi tasking there is no delay at all….hope in long run it remains the same…I am still little doubtful abt Exynos processor after few months….but this processor is tried and tested by samsung in many phones so hoping for the best…

  Liked almost everything about the phone. Except video / movies in dark light where images become pixelated. One more thing is lag in apps such as Smule for instance...Edit 1: after 5 days usage- Without a proper back cover, it is very slippery- Due to the massive battery size, the phone is on the heavier side- Some Apps are not having the proper aspect ratio due to the new dimension of the phone- The screenshot option is very inconvenient as compared to my previous phone, Xiaomi Note 4, that one was so easy to use!- I shifted to this non-Chinese phone (of course when the chance came) & expected it to be better but Chinese phones are surely VFM!- The processor is a huge let down! Seems that the RAM is unable to cope up with the lack of processing speed in this phone- The Camera is good yet using the same will take some more time for a Samsung non-userSome more updates in Edit 2!!!

  There is too much problem in this phone.1.  6000Mah battery but phone doesn't work even half day on standby mode.2.  In 64MegaPixel camera quality is too bad as per expactation.3.  Not working properly any sensor in phone (Face & Fingerprint).4.  It's too much time taken to charge the full battery approx more than 6hrs.Please don't buy this worst phone.

  Very nice phone. I am normal mobile user.. No games.. Just msgs and calls.Used it for couple of days.Below are the points.Pros1. Best display.2. Side finger scanner is fast.3. Good battery life.4. Very good camera for day and Night.5. Feels lightweight and grip is good in hand.CONS1. PLASTIC BODY.2. Quality of Charging cable is ordinary.3.

  Cons:Button position (power& volume) too highThough the battery capacity is high, battery drains fast.A lot of bloatware. Removed loads of stuff, tons still left.Width is less, height is more.The width is less than my MotoG5s+ and hence it disturbs viewing experience e.g. when viewing a YouTube video in a vertical manner.Pros:The fingerprint reader integrated to the power button is nice (touch to open, press down to lock)Does not feel too heavyNice display.The camera is decent.25W charger better than 15W of the M31

  good product under budget. Got it for 18K in Amazon sale.Phone is not heavy weight though it has big battery.Excellent display with L1 support.Super fast charger.Good camerasSide finger print sensor is very good.Stylish gradient design.Few things I personally didn't like:Build quality - seems very fragile.Too much of pre installed software by Samsung.No back cover included in the box.Phone looks very long (depends on personal choice).I am not a gamer.All in all best budget SUPER AMOLED mobile in this price range.

  Two issues detected :1. There is a considerable voice fluctuation in the RECEIVER of the device. While talking on call, the voice of person on another end fluctuates (decrease & increase frequently).2. The Single Take camera feature is not working properly. When I capture from Single Take, it only gives 3 videos but not the 7 photos along with that (which, it is not meant for).One could ignore the non working of camera feature once, but RECEIVER related issue can not be overlooked.When any new model is launched in the market, it is recommended to wait atleast 1-1.5 months from buying it, so that the detected bugs would be fixed by the company in the devices manufactured afterwards.I made a mistake, hope it helps others.

  You got for what you paidPros:1. Excellent display & Camera2. Better sound output3. Battery4. Support for Widevine l1 (For streaming Full HD contents of Netflix,  Amazon Prime, etc)5. Glastic back6. Headphone JackCons:1. Lots of bloatware (Even if you choose to skip while setup, it will eventually install later on)2. No NFC3. Little heatup issues then and there4. No phone case or Screen guard provided5. Year old processor which may slowdown with updatesI haven't tried any games yet. So cannot comment on the processor's maximum capability.At 19k, this phone really worth for its Camera & Display

  I m not sure to call this a budget phone or a mid range phone. But worth the cost. Got it delivered as promised and seems to have good battery life. It's the 2nd day, I still have got 50% after watching few movies. If you have craze for the features and don't have money to buy a high end phone, then 31s is a better choice. The product is a little bulky than my MiA1. The display is just at it's best. Amoled. Phone doesn't seem to heat. But charging isn't in 97 mins as said. I find it to be around 110-120 mins just like normal phones. But the battery discharge is quite good. Found stock android to be a little flexible comparatively. But not to complaint. Overall it's one of the best phones I have ever had. Phone supports dual SIM + SD Card. Really Quality phone Made in India.

  I ordered M31s twice as first time cameras were defective and didnt work at all. I had to call amazon 5-6 times in the whole process to replace the product. But amazon refunded my money instead of replacement. Disappointed with amazon service and samsung quality.I ordered it again second time by paying additional Rs. 1500 as earlier it was in offer (SBI Card).Honest rating:Battery 5*Display quality 5*Performance/Speed 2* Very slow processor anf it hangs even playing youtube videos.Camera 1*Its main highlighting feature is cameras which perform totally opposite from its too much hype. The captured image pixels gets distorted even on slight zoom. Very poor cameras. Even a 16 mp camera performs better than its 64 mp intellicam. Selfie camera is also not good. Highly overpriced phone with poor cameras. Worst phone in this price range.

  NO 4G Network mode option available to set the mobile network for 4G connection. Only 3G/LTE option exist screen shot attached. This is the most basic setting shockingly missing.My Vodafone 4G SIM works good in my other OPPO F3 mobile after setting network mode as 4G.If I didn't get solution either from  Amazon or Samsung, I will return this mobile.

  Awesome camera qualityPowerful batteryNice build qualityExynos 9611 is not bad, I mean trust me if you are a working person an average mobile user, you won't feel any issue with this processor.If you are looking for non Chinese brand, you can choose this phone blindly.If you compare with price this phone is much better than One Plus Nord. I am not even going to comparing this phone with cheap and disgusting Redmi, Oppo, Vivo etc. phones.

  The first Best part is wifi calling. Now you don't have to run to your balcony to catch some signals if you have a wifi connection.Second best part is that it has a very beautiful tag line - Made In India!Battery is literally a monster. No matter how heavy user you are. It will long last atleast a full day. For me it is 1.5 days.Screen quality is better than my iphone 7. Thanks to SAMOLED.Camera quality is again better than iphone 7. Thanks to 4 cameras.Processor is mediocre. Nothing great to boast about it. With this respect iphone 7 was smoother.Android vs IOS... once again ios is lot better than android.Overall happy with Samsung M31s4.5 out of 5 stars

  All in all the mobile is very good. Especially the display is tremendous in this price segment,but there is an issue of heating on this mobile. Mobile gets hot after 10 minutes of use. I want to know from the Manufacturer that can it be fixed in software update!!??

  This is just an amazing phone. The camera is really good, Samsung's OneUI is feature rich, but the display and battery are the real MVPs here. For such a huge battery, the phone doesn't feel that heavy, lighter than phones within this price range.But that's because they use glass, and Samsung uses a material which is basically plastic, and to be honest, I would pick plastic over glass anyday. Glass is glass and glass breaks. Besides there is no point in having a glass back if it doesn't have wireless charging as well right?Speaking about the camera, it is very similar to any mid-ranger, but the highlight I would say is Single Take. It is not only just fun to use, but is very helpful as well. I didn't expect to like it this much. It is amazing.Now the display, it's huge. And it's vibrant. It's just a pleasure to look at. Sure it may be 60Hz, but the sAMOLED panel is a cut above the rest.And the 6000mAh battery is coupled with a 25W fast charger, which charged the phone reasonably fast, about 80 minutes from 10% to 98%. This is definitely a two-day phone as I am a mid-weight user, primarily media consumption.The one glaring issue: THE PROCESSOR, and in extension the GPU. It is noticeably inferior to Snapdragon 720g, 730g and the 730 which you can find in phones of similar price range. The difference is not that apparent in daily usage, but I'm sure it will impact a lot if you scroll through media a lot, or if you game a lot. So if you're a gamer, I would suggest a Chinese OEM, they have better hardware for the price.In conclusion, if you are a media consumer who also uses the camera a lot, buy this phone without a doubt. If you are anything more - a gamer, a person who wants to future-proof their phone etc.. I would look elsewhere.I love this phone as this fits my usage perfectly.

  Honestly I rarely review on products. I expected a lot from Samsung Galaxy m series particularly from m31s. I purchased one m21 for my father, m31 for sister and m31s for my self on exchange of Oppo f9. I was very happy when I received m31s. But disappointed about the poor packaging. Still I manage my anxiety to taste the set. The handset is having absolute premium looks. Again the picture quality of captured photos disappointed me. Battery is unable to give feelings of 6000mah. Its like less than 4000mah. Network is comparatively weak. Followed the procedure for replacement. The technician asked to install Blancco app to run diagnostic. Then he asked me to go for battery calibration test which is a one day process. Again followed the process of replacement. The technician checked all things and at last told me that the replacement may not be possible for this m31s rather adviced me to go for refund process. The foolish technician rarely knew the process of exchange purchase. On my second attempt of replacement process I came to know that, the first technician registered my complain as the problem is in m21. How foolish. I have compared my m31s with another m31s purchased by my neighbor where I found my set as weaker one. IF REPLACEMENT DONE IN NEAR FUTURE BY AMAZON I WILL BE SATISFIED AND RATE IT AS 5STAR OTHERWISE I WILL WITHDRAW MY PRIME MEMBERSHIP AND CLOSE ALL RELATIONSHIPS WITH AMAZON.

  Firstly I am giving 1star because of its processor I think samsung must upgrade Exynos processor.... And after 2 days use the phone heat too much and battery drained very fastPros..1. Best camera and camera features specially singal take2. Best battery 6000 mah with reverse charging and 25 watt fast charging3. SAmoled Display one of the best display you can say ...Cons...1. Processor It's not so bad but you can say old one..2. I feel some network connectivity issu in my airtel3. Build quality- It is not bad but if the use glass body then it could be much better4. Overpriced 1.5k or 2k5. Heating issue6. Battery draining issue7. It take 3 hours to full charge

  I bought this cellphone as my backup phone, within 8 days of usage there is sudden pigmentation around bottom left of the screen. Amazon shows that replacement was valid only till 16th Aug, 10 days from date of order but not from delivery.Since its a newly launched model service center is saying that they dont have spares. I am helpless now.

  Samsung galaxy m31s is most anticipated mobile ever because of its unique mixture of A and M series mobile features. It's the 1st mobile in M series to provide many flagship features like single take, 25w fast charging, infinity O display and even  it is secured by knox.Pros:1.Big battery and it's quite good with 1 and half day use. A light user definately gets 2 complete.days.2. Camera is also pretty good with more flagship features bundled in it.3. Display is an advantage in any samsung mobile. It does pretty well and looking very much premium.4. Loud speaker. Samsung doesn't teased about it but sound quality is really satisfying.5. Knox security is available but may be with limited functions. I haven't seen secured folder or nfc which are still differentiating it with A series mobile.6. Experience is good. I'm not a gamer, so overall i haven't noticed any issues with UI, software or processor.7. Looks are really premium. Metallic finishing gave stunning look to the mobile but note that it comes with plastic body only.Cons:1. Although the charger is of 25W charger, it's taking 2hours to charge completely.. may be because of monster 6000mah battery.2. Side mounted fingerprint scanner. It's a con since i haven't used it before and it's bit difficult to use.3. Phone is slightly heavy but that's because of battery but weight balance is good.Finally, if you are a heavy user but not with heavy games and looking for a clean android experience other than MIUI , colour os etc which will have adware in the apps, this mobile is a perfect purchase for you.

  I appreciate the camera quality of M31s.. the selfie camera has a quality as your rear camera and the night shots or shots in dark are much better. The rear camera has a nice focus though not able to take clear long distance shots (100mts) which are very far but shots within 20-30 meters are perfect.I was impressed by the performance and charging as well. I have a 6GB Ram as i'm not a gamer hence could not comment but else good battery life.

  Here's an honest review after a week's usage. Please take the time to read the pros and cons of this device. I'll start with the pros first.Pros:• The Samsung display never disappoints, very good colors.• The device is pretty smooth to use, there's no lag whilst browsing and using multiple apps in the background.• Sound output is decent for this price range.Cons :• The battery life, its supposed to last atleast a day and a half with this 6k mah battery, but i get only 10 hours of battery life with a normal usage such as WhatsApp, YouTube, music and browsing.• Finger print scanner is not upto the mark, since it's narrow and thin button, it doesn't recognise the print sometimes. I have thick fingers and maybe its because of that.• Face unlock is pathetic, I sometimes think that it's scanning someone else's face at times. Most of the time it never recognises my face eventhough I've registered my face in a bright environment. During low light, forget about it.• Notifications bug, when I play a WhatsApp audio or voice note, it constantly notifies me which is annoying. And whilst riding and listening to music, if there's a notification in the BG, after every song it notifies me which is annoying eventhough I turned off notification reminder.• Camera quality is decent but not great like how they've advertised. Some low light shots are grainy and only in bright environments it can capture some good pics.• No screen recording and no notification lights, although this can downloaded from the play store, there's an app for it. But the whole point is this is an android phone and its the basic feature, my previous cheap Chinese Huawei phone had more features.Anyway, overall I wouldn't recommend this if you're just looking for the battery life because it'll disappoint you. I'm quite disappointed with this phone and I doubt if I'd go for Samsung again. Thanks for reading, good day.

  My issue:I purchased this mobile to play PubG or other games but play games on this mobile is now a dream because it's stucking during play and Amazon is not providing any return and replacement option while my return window is still open.Regarding Amazon service:This time amzon changed their policy, so only replacement option available, but you won't be able to replace it because if you are facing any issue then it's technical staff will not approve or accept it.Regarding Samsung:I tried samsun mobile device this time but this company haven't changed so far. They are showing super fast processor or ram but you won't be able to play any game like PubG or any other game, all games are stucking. I will not recommend samsung mobile, you can buy note 9 pro insted of these samsung mobiles.Conclusion before buying any product on Amazon please check they are providing return and replacement option, if they are providing only replacement option then Don't buy those products from Amazon because it's a trap.Don't waste your money on Amazon because they have proven that we should not buy any product online. Because after purchasing if you are facing any issue afterwords their support team will not help you to return it.Thia is just my review and chalanges that I'm facing with AmazonGod bless you guys.

  I bought this phone only the reason it have a best camera. But after 5 days use i am not satisfied with this phone. Reasons:-1. Camera:  It's not up to the mark. In low light photo is very bad.photo looks blur. In night also camera not good. Only v can take good photo in evening. That time all phones give us better photos.No AI support in camera. And portrait mode is in not in one click, its also not perfect. Macro also not good.2. Battery: The 6000 battery feels like 4500mah battery. One day we can use.3. Processer: now I don't feel any lag,but all youtube videos we can see this processor is not good enough for this phone.4. There is no second space option, No IR remote and gallery doest have discover,album options like iphone and honor phone.5. No screen recording option and no network speed showing option.Pros:1. In single shot we can get many videos and photos.2. Great display & design3. Smooth touch & fast fingerprint sensor.

  #Processor is the main drawback#Camera is super awesome in day light but struggles in low light conditions.# Finger print sensor accuracy is 60%## Phone is overpriced if we compare with other brands..## 9611 Exynos is a junk and my Redmi note 5 pro is performaning better than the 9611 chipset!#Screen is a treat for eyes undoubtedly.Charges in 97min. from 0-100% in switch off mode.Doesn't overheat at all.Sound is above average..Voice quality is good.Signal reception is goodAll should be neglected but aged and lagging processor is a thumbs down!!

  Another excellent M series mobile from Samsung.  Look of the mobile is elegant. The Amoled screen is very much vibrant and better than the previously launched M30s . Also i felt that the screen size is slightly 2 mm larger than M30s. The front camera is placed slightly 2mm lower than the top edge, henceforth may hinder video viewing in the enlarged screen mode. The battery is a monster with 6000 mAh , so need not worry about charging for atleast 2 days with respect to the way I use. Also thanks to reverse charging facility that samsung introduced in this model. Any gadget that has c-port can be charged directly with the charging cable provided as the both ends of the charging cable are of c- port. I think this feature is only introduced by Samsung in the budget range of less than 20k . However for connecting to the laptop I may have to use the M30s charge cable.  Also there is no heating problem during charging. Also the charging time is approx one and half hour from zero to full charge, which i believe is decent for a battery with capacity of about 6000 mAh.The sound quality is great. The camera quality - primary 64MP and front - 32 MP are awesome. There is a flash available for front cam as well similar to retina flash on iPhone 7 plus. Depth ( similar to portrait mode in iPhone) and Macro modes ( useful for capturing smaller size objects) are decent though not excellent. I am yet to check wide angle mode of camera. Also I am yet to check the night mode shots. Also there are other special features like single click are easy to use . It will capture a bunch of photos and video from which the best and required ones can be chosen and rest can be deleted. There are other features like single video recording on front and back cam , smart selfie option which I am yet to explore and review the quality as I just received the mobile . Also I liked the concept of introduction of finger print on the power  button on the right side. The specification of processor, RAM and storage space are decent for the price paid. Also i believe that samsung is offering the mobiles at the decent spec at lesser price when compared to other premium brands like one plus, MI etc.,. Also thanks to Amazon for delivering the mobile within 5 days, i.e., a week earlier than the promised date as I see that the mobile is not available at the time of order placement, because of the demand. Earlier I bought 2 qty of M30s and I had a very good experience of using them as i never experienced any performance issues with them. Also the M series mobiles are quite sturdy. Now I believe that I will have a much better experience with M31s. Thanks to samsung for the continual launch of better quality mobiles at a very competitive price. Also the samsung galaxy eco system of apps and cloud are pretty decent . Also I have a good experience with the services of samsung incase of any damage to the mobile. Overall I am happy with the product and also with the services of samsung and Amazon.

  My first ever Samsung phone...Feels like a premium phone when you hold it in your hand.Display is awesome. It is very bright even in outdoors.Weight of the phone is little bit more. But it didn't feel heavy, because Samsung has done its weight balance in pretty good manner.Processor is good, didn't feel any lag till now.Fingerprint scanner is a little bit slow. Sometimes it needs to press hard to scan.Camera quality is also good especially in daylight. But typical Super slow motion video(which I like most) is of limited duration.Battery last for 24-30 hrs for normal use (battery optimization could be better). The battery life can be improved by changing power mode in the setting.The 25W charger is also very good. And it is ""Made in India"".Samsung UI is also good.Samsung should have provided at least a case with this 20k phone. It is hard to find case in the market for a newly launched phone.Overall worth for the money. 4.5/5 star.Better than the Chinese phones.Do buy the Samsung phones instead of the cheap Chinese phones.

  A worst phone and worthless.Camera quality is poorTakes blurry shotsThere is no easy way to click slefies as phone length is more its hard to reach buttons. The palm sensor takes blurred selfies and delay in loading pictures.Any Chinese phone of 10k is much better than thisPerformance is not upto the mark as they claim. Fingerprint sensor takes time to unlock the phone. Hardly recognizes the face. Phone is not quick on opening app or anything.Width of the phone is less compare to other 6.5 inch phonesIts an absolute waste of money.This phone is worth of 8k and I have wasted my money in this worthless due to its hyped advertisement  and just to get rid of Chinese products

  I purchased this phone on 6th August, but still I can't use the phone. Only because tempered glass and back cover is not available.

  So here you'll get my honest opinion about samsung M31s??I just got this phone.I ordered this phone on first launch day from amazon.Question 1:- What do i think about this phone in this range?Answer:- This phone in this range is quite good but if you're a samsung lover or you boycott chinese product and don't want to buy a chinese phone like mi,realme.You can go for it.Question2:- What do you think about specifications in this range?Answer:- Specification what i like most is Display quality,good battery backup,fast charging,good camera and process is still being tested so keep in touch on telegram @guptajitalks .Question 3 :- Should i purchase this phone in this range?Answer:- Umm i'll suggest you to go for it if you're a samsung lover and your priority is batter backup,fast charging,video watching,camera then please go for it but if in the past you've used realme,or mi phone then don't purchase it because you'll miss some of their feature which is not available in this phone you need to install extra applications for them from play store or other source.Question 4:- Should i purchase Samsung M31 or M31s??Answer:- If your main priority is fast charging and you want to use a new updated fingure print sensor you can go for it otherwise everything is similar in this phone.Choose according to your budget.Question5 :- Does fingure print work fine?Answer:- Fingure print senson is working awesome.I was also getting hesitate but now i am feeling relax because it's working fine and smooth.Question 6 :- Anything else if you want to ask then text me on telegram @guptajitalksAnswer:- Will be updated soon??I want to mention something:-??????Note:- 1.Camera,charging,display,cable,Video watching experience is awesome.Processor is still being tested.2.You'll miss some feature if you previously used mi or realme phone.You need to install extra app for it.

  After using 10 days:1. It's not look like 6000mah battery. Other brands phone in below 5000mah, can give more backup than this.2. Very bad wifi receiver. Not able to capture wifi signal properly. Same thing for reverse case means mobile hotspot. It's not able to transmit high range. Trust me if you think I am wrong, just make a comparison with you any old phone and see the difference.3. If both sim card are on, in 2nd sim you are getting call, after disconnecting call sometimes network is fluctuating. It's taking some time to stable.4. If you are dropping your phone to bed, some sound is coming. It seems sim tray is casing this noise.5. Lock or Finger print scanning button which is mounted in right side is making sound (tik tik) while pressing it. It's not smooth.Please check your phone and don't forget to add comments here wheather you are facing or not the same. I am waiting for all your inputs.

  Lets talk about the positives first:Design & Build - Compelling for this Price range. Fingerprint Magnet - AlertDisplay - Damn, This is the best.Software Experience - This is not a clean UI but I like this feature that Samsung almost took customization to the next level.Camera - Decent, Sony sensors does its job and Samsung's camera features is like a cherry on top.Multimedia Experience - This is what the phone is good at. Believe me it wont disappoint you either.Battery - Humongous. and Fast Charger is in the box. No need to worry about the battery backup.Cons:-Not major but noticeable.Weight :- You ll definitely feel it when used for a long period of time.Performance - This is not so good as the competition provides for this price range. You can notice it heavily while scrolling Twitter.  But everything is usable. Just a little bit of boost to the performance would have taken this phone to the next level.Phone gets little bit warm which is also noticeable. ( I don't know if only I have that issue)Overall - (Gamer boy, Performance Addict) - Just Ignore thisPeople like me those who could sacrifice that little performance for a good multimedia experience should definitely give it a try. And that display, you ll definitely fall in love with it.

  Amazing device under 20kIf you are a camera lover then believe me you won't be disappointed.I have purchased this device in first sale. Awesome delivery experience.Thanks to seller and Amazon india for diliver my package soon.

  The screen of the phone was broken when we received it. On calling the customer service, they can't replace the product since it's out of stock so we filed for a refund. The pickup agent denied picking up the product saying he needs a confirmation email first. When we called the customer support we were told that the pickup guy reported that the imei was mismatched which is why he didn't pickup but in reality he didn't even check imei. Since then we filed for a pickup 4 times and nobody has shown up to pick it up. Pathetic behaviour by the Bhopal logistics team. The Amazon support talks very politely to us and assure us of pickup but then do nothing about it.

  Purchased it on sale day, received in 2 days. 5* for Amazon delivery & service. Samsung M31s 8GB 128GB is the best to buy product in around 20k with 6000mah battery & amoled display. Camera is far better than M31 as it used Sony sensor. Works like charm with no lag, beautiful display, good camera, easy too handle, not much of bloatware & many can be disabled/uninstalled of not needed. Overall a good to buy product. 1* less rated due to dual core back cover design, which is not of ok & not much impressive. Otherwise all good. Go for it.

  Best Super Amoled display ,very smooth experience  ,Brilliant  Quad Cmera,Amazing  battery life thanks to huge 6000mah Battery , Fingerprint sensor is very fast and accurate and also  i like the position of sensor,phone supports hdr ,easy to hold ,feel premium,little bit heavier than my old phone (who has 5000mah battery)i suggest you to apply case otherwise you can see some scratches on backoverall phone is excellent

  First of all thanks to amazon for its lightning fast delivery..phone is delivered within 1 day??...now come to the phone...samsung has beautiful gorgeous display..sound is awesome..camera is too good to be tdue ..and battery life is non replacable...overall i will give it 9 out of 10..only con is the processor..dont take me wrong..it is very efficient for daily day use but if u are a hard core gamer then it might not be for u..i will upload my review later on finally

  1) excess Heating while charging, using camera, using for more than 2 Minutes.2) Camera is really good, loved AR3) Charger really charge it fast but battery, whatever mentioned as 6000 Mah, doesnt really upto the mark.4) some time FaceID doesnt work, FaceID is slow.5) Touch quality is not good.6) Side mounted Fingerprint reader doesnt give expected result.7) overall disappointed with this. wont opt for samsung in future.

  This is best phone under 20k range and also easily beats many phones under 30k as well.Pros:1. Samsung  brand value2. sAmoled screen, best display, amazin color reproduction, supports Always on Display3. Best in class camera with sony imx 682 sensor, better than many other high range phones as well.4. Single take camera feature works superb5. Amazing low light photography6. 25W superfast samsung charger in this price range and monster battery 6000 mah which easily works of minimum 1.5 to 2 days7. Knox security8. Cool body finishing9. Side mounted finger print sensor, better than back and indisplay finger print sensor10. Small punch hole display in front for camera which makes screen even better. Thats great as compared to pill shaped 2 camera or U camera.11. Sapphire camera glass. Checked this in one of the m31s durability test. It does not get scratched even with level 7 scratches.12. Thanks to samsung for not skipping 3.5mm camera jack13. Dolby audio in headphonesand bluetooth speaker14. Loud loudspeakerCons:Nothing as suchOnly better processor would have been cherry on cake. But i am not a gamer and this processor handles day to day usage easily without any lags or slowness.Overall amazing phone without any limitation in budget and mid range.Will upload phone and camera samples soon.

  This device is supposed to charge from 0 to 100% in 97 minutes.However, the product I received takes 3 hours to charge fully.How could this be 25 W superfast charging?! Hope no one else is facing this issue.Need to replace my device!

  I liked the camera on M31s and I think it's the best camera on a phone under 20k. Apart from that samsung is making Chinese manufacturers sweat by slowly focusing on mid range mobile category so yeah we can expect great phones under low budget as well.  Only thing which I don't liked about this device is Exynos 9611 as it is an old processor & shows its age while gaming. Apart from that everything is ""monster"" ??.

  Facial recognition is not working itself and Its says 64MB camera but its only in writings not in performance.6000 MAH battery but it will drain in 8hrs (Not even Continues) if you watch basic youtube and normal FB browsing. I will not recommend this mobile if anyone wish to by only for Camera and battery
",,

  Phone functions are good but charging is slow not like as fast as advertised..  It took almost  one and half hour to reach out 75% from 20% like other handsets.. I don't find any speciality in fast charging or charger.

  Very disappointed with Samsung and Amazon...Camera hangs and single shot mode doesn't works properly...Sometimes it gives only three outputs and sometimes 7...It never gives 10 outputs as claimed by brand...

  A perfect phone made by Samsung in mid range. Camera perfect, Body style perfect, Battery perfect  & much more. But a thing I don't understand that why Samsung made charger cable C to C, it would better if it comes with USB to C which helps us to connect it easily with many devices like powe bank,  Desktop and etc.And one more thing I like to suggest to Samsung that, it will be more better if Samsung gives a back cover with every smartphone because in market back covers are available after 3-4 weeks of phone launch & all of us know that it is how risky to use a smartphone without cover.
",,

  Faulty mobile phone received. To charge this phone, it takes around three hours to charge upto 65%, while operating the phone, charging indicator showing @5%.Spoke to amazon customer service about this issue. As per them technician assigned to inspect the phone. After technician's report they will replace the phone.

  Phone which I received is getting warmer around the ear piece area even for short duration calls (less than 2 min) when I made a compliant to Amazon and Samsung they say it's completely normal.My question is how can a earpiece gets warmer even for a short duration calls then how could I take calls comfortably.Better to stay away from this device until we have the complete review or fix for this product.

  Camera quality is great. SonyIMX sensor rocks. Night mode is awesome. Screen Display quality is a treat for eyes, brilliant sAMOLED. Battery is Monster.Only one issue of data transfer from laptop due to lack of USB cable. Mobile shipped with Type C to Type C cable for charger/reverse charger. Samsung should add flexible back cover and USB to C port cable in the box.Ad free UI. Simple and useful. And most important it is made in India. GO for it. Good choice over cheap unsafe Chinese items.

  Awesome loaded by samsungI have upgraded from m30sDisplay was new feel with punch hole.Fingerprint and face unlock was faster.Felt good at camera aspect with stunning picture outcomeOnly disappointment is plastic backApart that everything was good and for a heavy user just blindly go with m31s

  You do not have to check any of the specification just buy blindly, only think on it before buying if you  are a heavy GAMER because this phone is not for gaming purpose it is pure BUSINESS phone.

  Not happy with amazon service. Guys it is 20K+ Rs cellphone..the back cover is not fitted properly and it could damage display..In spite of having replacement policy amazon failed to provide replacement and providing refund..this is going to be painful experienceas I have exchanged my reliable Nokia as it was having less tech spec and I purchased this cellphone on EMI..this made situation slightlycomplicated. I am thinking to file a case against Amazon in consumer court..Samsung plz take care of your product quality..not expected from giant like you who is a big game changer and invest lot of money in R&D. Poor quality control and pre dispatch  inspection.I'd never buy Samsung  again.

  The mobile was delivered on Aug 12, much before it was showing earlier. I was using MiMax2, a Chinese product and was happy to use that and had decided to patronise Mi in future. But with current concept of avoiding Chinese products altogether, I ordered Samsung M31s. Initially, it looked to be smaller that Mi max2, though both having 6.5 display. But later on realised that M31s is a bit longer that Mi max2 thus both the phones have the same square cm area!The mobile is fantastic in everything. The finger sensor at the power key on the side is comfortable, so is the face recognition; I am enjoying it. I have set all three, pattern, finger sensor and face recognition for opening it. I could easily install dual WhatsApp. Two sims with external memory card is appreciable, with Volte in both sims always on. Camera should be good; I do not use it much.I could not find a system of locking/unlocking individual app through finger sensor, as I was having in mi max2, nor a shortcut for using torch when in haste. Yet happy for discarding a Chinese mobile and substituting with a good one, Samsung M31s. Go for it.

  Well this is my Jump from Galaxy J7 prime(2016) to this one.  It makes a big difference overall.But don't expect everything to be Premium, honestly speaking1. Camera is not like how it was hyped. It is decent and I was not expecting much from Samsung.2. Display is wonderful you will enjoy High end videos.3. Sound output is good.4. Battery I would like to say it took me exactly 1 hours 44 mins to charge from 0 to 100%. On the other hand it went from 100 to 96% In 23 mins while playing You tube music on Speaker it was connected through Wi-fi, no SIM connection and No any apps in background.5. Processor is fast. It can handle many apps at a time.Rest it is a wonderful fone and I don't have any complaints as you don't have any other non chinese fone is this price bracket.

  I'm a dentist and, I was searching for a phone in my budget; as well as, a phone with the best of specifications. I saw this beauty put up on the Amazon sale. And I believe it was one of my best decisions to buy it. The delivery was fast within a week and whole care of social distancing was taken by the Amazon Person.Coming to the model and the piece. •The Marble Blue colour is fabulous and the finishing is top class.•The camera quality is top-level, and the wide angle view makes photos look marvelous.•The night view gives the best of the image qualities even in absolute absence of light.•The best specification is the Macro Mode, which gives superb detailing, helping me get the best Intra-Oral pictures of my patients.•The side mounted fingerprint sensor is lightening quick, helps me open my phone in a jiffy.•The 6000mAh battery lasts the whole day, and still I haven't seen my battery bar going below 50%.•The 25W Ultra-Fast Charging saves my time in emergency situations.•The processor is so good & the phone works so smoothly, having 3-4 applications open at the same time is no more an issue.•The sound quality is so great (With Dolby Sound)*Pros:*•Best Camera Quality in this price range of mobiles.•A whole spectrum of specifications altogether.•Great Finishing, with a Great Look•Smooth Processing•Light Weighted, you don't even feel the phone in your hands.•The all new Side Mounted Fingerprint Sensor.*Cons:*The ones who are looking phones in 14-15K might find this one out of buget, but still by adjusting one should go for it, its definitely worthy.

  Having bought it 1 minute into the sale I'd have to say.... No regrets! Its really great at this price point! The battery is amazing, even though I understand 6000mah is large I've not charged my phone in 2 whole days and still going at 50%; the ultra wide is better than I expected and the phone is light! No idea what phone these youtubers  were using but it fits well in my hand and is not heavy! I normally abhor exynos but I will say this is a tried and tested processor with no lag at all when I'm using the phone but noticeably not that snappy at pubg but not the end of the world! I'd very easily recommend this phone to friends and family. A+

  A great mobile with some cons for 18K price tag(1.5k discount)Pros:Sleek design. Not that heavy in hands.Massive battery life. Almost two full days.Good call qualityExcellent fast charger. Charging 6000mah in 90 minutes is amazing.Cons:Awful unboxing experience. Felt like unboxing a 5000rs phone.No soft case. Very badNo Samsung pay even after paying nearly 20K.Though OneUI is sleek it feels too heavy. Lot of junk ware some of which can be removed but why we need in first place. Why does galaxy store even exists. It started installing some idiotic apps as soon as I opened. Had to remove all the permission to galaxy store to stop it. Major negative.Camera need some software fix. Focusing issues are there.Power button is filmsy

Deliverywas fast it came earlier  2 days. I'm  happy .also the charger has a feature  reversecharging  so if u want to transfer anything we need to buy separate  cable .I won't  play PUBG so I don't know for gamers but for normal games it runs smoothly. I'm  very Disappointed because they don't  provide any case so if u buy also add temperglass and case it's  my personal request so that u can enjoy ur mobile from the  first day onwards..Samsung team we r buying  mobile for 20000 y can't u afford headphone and case for customer.  Other than everything u have done a great  job. I hope u guys find my review useful.

  1. Battery drains quickly not like Samsung Galaxy M31s2. Overheating, due to this your apps in multi window will close3.

One must use this personally then can  review.

  Cons.1.When you zoom the clicked pic it gets distorted overall nice camera.2.Processor should be upgraded.3.On screen fingerprint should be given than the side.4. Slight width should be increased5. At least a case should be given for the protection of the phone.6. Not much difference between M31 & M31s.Pros.1.Samsung screen is always a good and indeed a infinity experiences.2.UI/UX is good on this one overall a stock Android experience no bloatware or extra + lastest Android version 10.3.Camera is 8.8/10 (from my view).4.Massive battery 6000mah + 25W fast charger5.

  Phone is pretty much cool but bit heavy .I prefer if it will be more slim and light .The display is good and the camera is superb .Everything is good for me .Most impressive feature is super fast charging and most disappointing is that the battery is draining very fast and I have used it for only 5 days now .Very much disappointed with the overall battery ?? performance .It is no where in performance near to Redmi Phones ,Realme or One plus .I am now thinking that I have wasted my money coz it is not worthy for its rate ..What is surprising that there have been no original invoice in the package and its shocking to notice that .

  I was looking for a new phone in the Samsung brand I must say galaxy M31s is the best choice, that too at such a reasonable price.I have been using this phone for over a week now and following are my  views on the phone.1. Delivery by Amazon just the next day of my purchase. Thanks Amazon!2. The size of the phone is quite appropriate,it stays in my pocket easily and can be used single handed. It has a metal like finish3. As far as the display is concerned, crisp and clear with infinity- O display, absolutely soothing to the eyes.4. Sound quality - It has a premium quality Dolby sound and I just love to hear music on this phone.5. The 1st best feature if this phone is it's battery with 6000 mAh. Even if I don't charge my battery lasts for at least 2 days. Also the charger is very fast.6. The 2nd best feature is the camera. It has 4 cameras having best depth and clarity of 64mp with ultra wide lens and macro camera. The clarity of the front camera is outstanding for selfies!I would strongly recommend this phone, you can't get anything better in this range..

  Very nice and handy phone. Excellent camera, with very useful Single Take feature.Look of the phone is premium with the shaded back cover giving it a premium feel.Battery is good @ 6000mAh, enough to last a full day easilyScreen resolution is the best feature of Samsung phone, and this one also doesn't disappoint.Overall a very good buy at this price... Highly recommended

  For the first time when I turned the device on out of the box, the device was named as Kamal's Galaxy M31s. Now I dont know who that kamal is!!  Can any one tell me why it is named as Kamals and who that kamal is?  Themes also show as "" Themes recommended for kamal"".  This makes me feel like the device has been used by somebody else before and then remanufactured it and sent it to me.Device manufacturing is of very poor quality (not the mobile phone).  Looking at the box and its packaging, it does not look premium quality.  In fact, the package feels very cheap.  There was no back cover and screen guard provided at all in the box.  This definitely feels like it is manufactured by some local people not by the company like Samsung.  M series being specifically manufactured for India.  This shows how cheap the company sees at the Indians to give this kind of worst packaging and quality.  You can even check the printing on the sticker attached at the back of the mobile with imei numbers.  How cheap quality printing it was. (Check out the images. I even attached photos of my redmi box and u will make out the difference).Mobile phone definitely hangs sometimes.  I faced hanging issue while closing telegram app.  I also faced abrupt closure of apps in the middle on its own while installing all the necessary apps in the mobile.Camera wise, rear camera is good, but front camera is not up to the mark.  In low light conditions there is definitely a lot of noise in the photos taken with front camera.Display wise, it is Excellent being a superamoled display. However, they should have given 90Hz refresh rate for the price of mobile.I am not a gaming person so I dont know about gaming performance in this phone.I had high expectations  on this phone and purchased it with a huge excitement and enthusiasm, but this mobile does not meet the expectations and it disappointed me a little bit.I am somewhat a lover of samsung products especially display related products like mobiles and TV.  But, this time I am little disappointed with cheap manufacturing of the product.  Then again, display quality is very good. Other than that, rest of the things really disappointed me in this phone.

  Overall this is a phone for non gamers, camera lovers and for media consumption. It has been a mixed reaction with 15 days usage. More details below. Thank you for reading.Pros;Display: 10/10 nothing more to say.Camera:Back cameras are really good with all four of them being useful in different conditions. Apart from the 64MP primary sony sensor the 12MP wide angle and 5MP macro sensor give good quality pics and not there as a gimmick.Front camera is a mixed bag. Under slightly low lighting conditions it doesnt produce great pics and is bit grainy. Samsung please fix this with an update. But if you put the screen flash details are good.Colors are saturated which some will like and others may hate.Network Reception and data:So far so good. However, it is not the fastest w.r.t data download speeds under this price category. It depends on the modem that has been used.Battery: At first the 6000mah battery seemed like a 4000mah w.r.t performance showing battery drain issues. You need to check the device health statistics to determine the culprits. If you have turned on adaptive brightness (auto brightness) then battery consumption will be high. Since smasung uses the front camera for auto brightness. I would suggest you to turn it off. Secondly add apps which you don't use frequently to sleep and deep sleep under battery optimization. Also switch on the adaptive battery optimization. After all this now it finally lasts longer in the range of 40 - 44 hours in a single charge. Again it can vary based on your usage. But these steps will definitely increase your battery life per charge.Cons:Processor: Samsung please use a nice processor in such a good mid range smartphone. This is a downer. Almost everything else is good. Gamers please stay away from this phone. Day to day task are fluid but still you may notice occasional lags while opening some apps and animationsGlasstic Back: If you use a cover on your phone this may not be a concern. However, people who like the phone as is...may not be able to use it without worrying about a scratch.Weight of phone: Along with a good cover this phone can build your biceps. You can feel the weight.Overall people who use a phone for connecting, productivity, social media, vlogging and media consumption then this is a good one. Gamers will hate this for sure.

  I ordered the phone as soon as it went on sale, i.e on the midnight of August 6. I was unaware that it would only be available to prime users so I had to first subscribe to Amazon prime, and during this process the blue variant of the phone that I wanted to buy went out of stock. Nonetheless, I managed to order the mirage black 6gb variant which was the only one available at around 12:25 am.But yeah I would say that I'm not at all unsatisfied with the black one as it looks so stunning. The phone was delivered to me on the morning of August 9, that is pretty fast.It has been 2 days since I'm using the phone and I would say that there is a lot about the phone to boast. I'm so happy to have been able to buy this.Everything about this phone is so awesome but the two outstanding features of this phone are its premium looks and the rear camera. The rear camera captures stunning images in all light conditions and the quality of videos is also amazing. I really loved the single shot feature, its fun to use. One thing that I'm a little bit disappointed with is the performance of the front camera in low light. The sAmoled display is so cool, you won't face any problem operating your phone in the sunlight.The 25W charger is quite useful as it charges the phone at a blazing speed. The 6000 mAh battery lasts longs but I haven't tried extreme gaming yet.So guys just go for it! Nothing can be better than the Samsung Galaxy M31s at this price range.

  This is to share my horrible experience with Amazon and Samsung. The phone arrived with an irresponsive touch screen and I had to make multiple calls, emails to team to get it replaced. Even showed it to the Samsung customer care center.  After the technician report confirming that the phone is a defect piece, the only option available was to place it for a refund as it is no longer in stock.

  Good Phone for the price being a Samsung phonePros -A fantastic display, extremely colour acurate, vibrant, with great sunlight visibilityGood build quality, thought its plastc but looks gorgeousOne of the best camera performer around this price range here I am very specific because I am a photographer by professionInspite being a 6000 mah battery does not feel that hafty & well balenced to holdHeadphone sound output is best in class also the speakers, Media consumption on this phone is a fantastic experience.One UI is better then ever on a Samsung phone now, extremely stable & smooth nowCons -The processor is not that powerful at all, despite being the 8gb varient that I bought shows lag & stutter around the UI every now & then on heavy multitasking usage, high end gaming is also not a smooth experienceThe 6000mah battery sounds much but it doesn't last more then 1 day battery drains so quickly on this phone ( hopefully will be fixed by futer updates )The wifi hotspot only supports 5ghz band its not a duel band one on this phone so if u have a laptop or PC with 2.4 ghz wifi adapter, you won't be able to access the hotspot from this phone, I had to purchase a 5ghz wifi adaptor for my PCOne UI core version on this phone lacks so many features that we found on A series phone so thats a compromise on this phone specially I miss the lack of led notification on this phoneThe Camera to API on this phone does not support Google CameraOn the Camera department , it does not support 50/60 fps1080p, its only limited to 30fps thats a downside for me specificallyPhone does not support some graphic intense apps like .. Adobe Premiere rush, & few moreGorrila glass 3 is not that grat in terms of display protection, so installing a screen guard is a must, also the back is very proan to scratchesThe figer print sensor is good but not that fast like Xiaomi phones, also the face unlock misses so many times but thats also subjected to be fixed by updates.Overall its a good ""Samsung Phone"" if you dont run much graphic intence games or apps

  I've been using this phone for 2 weeks, extremely happy about the batery backup, fingerprint reader is really cool & impressive.About the camera quality it's been amazing.Apps opens faster and also multitasking is efficient. Really liked the always on display feature and dark mode. Also sound quality is awesome, & with headphones amazing experience as it provides Dolby Atmos feature while using headphones gets activated & you can enjoy the theatre like experience. Also very light weight considering the battery capacity, very easy to operate with one hand & touch sensitivity is also amazing even with screen gaurd. Battery gets charged from 10 to 100 in two hrs. Now no need to carry any power bank.

  This is my worst experience with amazon that too over samsung.I got the mobile delivered on 20th Aug.Packaging was good.I opened the box overall style is good in view.But when i switched on the phone,it directly opens up in safe mode after restarting also it was in that mode only.Again down volume key button was not working at all.Then I find the phone detecting sim without sim card only.The phone was generating more heat as compared .I called to amazon tech support ,I followed all the instruction according to them still there is no change.I requested for replacement where I saw in my page phone is in stock but they denied for replacement and just the option was refund.

  This is next level of M31, looks premium. I brought M31 for wife and now I purchased this. After comparing both....Cemera is of next level...Infinity O display looks premium, Side finger sensor feels cool...and finally mobile looks and feel very premium...Just simply go for this.

  while placing an order i was thinking about better SD chip-set phones ...but after seeing this mobile ....there is no difference performance ...Exynos does Better than expected coz OS is build accordingly....camera & Display =10/10battery=10/10side mounted fingerprint=8/10 (its the only thing not 10/10)feel in hand=10/10 ( premium...feels like 40K device..)social media and  heavy games (except Chinese games (#BoycottChina)),heavy web browsing=10/10!!

  Just got my hands on this beauty today morning, One word, beautiful, excellent display, smooth touch, fabulous camera....will write a more detail review after using it for some time. But first impressions last for long and M31s doesn't disappoint on the contrary it puts a smile on your face !!PS - Disappointed not to get out of the box back cover even for this price segment, had to run from shop to shop to find one as its a new phone in the market, was hard to get one but got it eventually.

  Battery life is not as per expectation with minimal use only 40% got discharged.Camera quality is better but best. Even Single take feature also not that much impressive, because it not give 10 pics always as per provided information of this feature (or else i dont how to use this feature, if i am doing anything wrong then pls let me know. If any configuration is required to use this feature pls let me know).Not given option of Microsoft office link, so i cant connect my laptop with phone.This is the review after one day use.Over all good.

  A major drawback which I found; when I'm on voice call, I can't connect to the internet...means you cannot send a photo on whattsapp while on voice call or cannot open chrome to check something...this was a major drawback on my previous phone also...but with today's advancement and latest phone, I did not expected this.....Being a businessman, very often I need to send photos on whatssapp while on call to discuss details at the same time....NOT POSSIBLE on Samsung M31s....rest all things are good at this price.

  Please do not buy Samsung Galaxy M31s model, I bought this model phone through Amazon on 8th August 2020 during lauching fest. Got delivery on 15th August, started using on18th August, today is 36th day, morning as usual I took the phone to switch on wifi to use, screen came on the all of a sudden screen gone total black out, booked service center through samsung toll free number, visted they couldn't do anything much, infact they returned my phone with sreen lights on, they cant do much only requested me to change mother board. I want Amazon to replace with a new phone. I am not willing to use a phone with this sort manufacture deffect.

  I am using the Galaxy M31s for a few days now. I will note the pros and cons as I have observed so far.Pros:1. The display is excellent. Vivid colors that pop, good contrast and definition.2. The touch response is butter smooth. I think it is at par with an iPhone.3. No lag, no heating issues, no screen problems so far.4. Battery life is very good.Cons:1. There is a huge amount of bloatware. I uninstalled most of them, but some cannot be uninstalled. I disabled or forced stopped them. I deleted 1 star because of bloatware.2. The side mounted finger print sensor is not very convenient. They should have given a normal real mounted FP, which is easier to use. I deducted another star because of side mounted FP.3. The face recognition feature does not work all the time, but that is a common issue across many other phones.

  Have a phone now with me... over all it is good non chinese and clean UI. I am chinese user earlier switch to samsung this time. Being a normal user it is ok with current processor (youtubers saying processor bla bla bla).Only giving 3 star rating cause no screen guard and case is provided in the box. Which is still not availble in market as well.When you got the box... i observed box quality is quite low as comoare to other brands however no problem..this is ignorable..every companies looking for cost cutting.Phone is good if you are normal user watching media and social networking sites and small gamers.Gamers definitely need to go with realme, mi, other brands having high antunu scores

  Things i like ::Excellent Display QualityWatched HD videos on Youtube/Netflix and it was just awesomeThe camera quality and software both are goodOne UI is certainly among the top UIs in android world after Oxygen OSBattery backup is among the bestI was little skeptical about the processing power but i normally play light games so that doesn't seem to be an issue. No issues in day to day task.Overall a good purchase

  Bought the device on the first day of its release. Have been using the same for more than a week now and below is the review of its real life performance:Pros:1. It has an amazing display. Samsung is an undeniable champion of amoled displays and this phone is not different in terms of its standards.2. The camera, both front and back, are an amazing tool to play with. The photos come out real sharp and detailed. The single take feature is very handy feature and will be a boon for any beginner who will be able to capture amazing moments with a single click.3. The performance is very snappy for daily use. It is not made for heavy gaming, however it will not disappoint for light gaming.4. The UI experience with the One UI is amazing and smooth.Cons:1. The placement of the fingerprint sensor on the power button and that can be tricky for some of the users to get used to with. 2. It is not supplied with cover and that is strange considering all the smartphones in the segment are supplied with one.Hope the review was helpful.Willl update the review if something noteworthy discovered while using the device.

  Reviewing this after 48 hours of arrival..So far So good..Haven't experienced any lags..This Samsung One UI is so easy to use than redmi UI (IMO).Build Quality:It is glasstic material in back and our hands are Imprinted ..So better to buy a Back case as soon as possible..On the sides I think its made of metal ..Could have gone with a different material but front looks stunning with a broad screen and a bit curved (4/5)Camera:Gives its best in high lightning areas and indoor shots are good too ....Night Mode is absolutely beauty and the single take feature is woww (4.5/5)Battery:First of all charged it for 7 hours and it took approximately 1.15 hour to charge from 30 to 100%.After a moderate usage for about 36 hours it has a charge of 50%. (4.5/5).Sensor:The side ways fingerprint is new and it is quick enough..Face Unlock is quite a bit slow..(4/5).Overall:Since I am not a gamer i prefer this phone is worth buying and tried adobe Lr Mobile..It is easier to use and in the range of 20,000 with a good UI with a moderate processor ..This is preferred.. It also comes with Knox Security

  Awesome phone better than realme and mi phones

  1. Fingerprint reader is very fast.2. Face unlock is a little slow though it can capture your face in a mid range dark room too.Disadvantage of the face unlock was once it cannot recognise your face it does not try again you'll have to use the fingerprint or password.3. Camera quality is amazing in the light but in the dark there's a little disturbance.4. The battery life is not that good as expected though they have advertised a lot about the battery being 6000mah. It's charges pretty fast.5. Reverse charging also works amazing though you cannot charge it to any phone which uses a B cable. Only C to C phones will work for this.6. A phone cover should have been provided with the amount taken. Plus its a little slippery so a phone cover is a must.Overall it's a good phone but these are a few pros and cons when buying the phone.

  If u r not interested in heavy gaming then can't get a better deal for a phone under 20k.Pros-1) Screen - there is no doubt Samsung does provide the best screen. U will notice that instantly,  and Super Amoled is really something if u r coming from ips led screen.2) Battery - Seriously what they advertise is real it really is a monster. Last from1.5 - 2 days depending on ur usage.3) Camera - This is the first time Samsung is using Sony sensor in there below 20k phone and boy can u tell the difference.  Sony sensor with Samsung image processing is just lit, hands down can't get better camera in this budget.4) Software- Being a past redmi and realme user i can tell how much software is important and oneui is very smooth with no blotwares or ads and works really well. I guess after oxygen os and stock Android,  one ui is right behind them.5) Design - This phone looks far better then it looks in images and overall weight balance is great , doesn't feel heavy at all even though having such a massive battery.Cons-1) No Knox security- Don't be confused by all the reviews u find online, there is no knox security included, idk why it shows secured by knox in boot menu but still there is no such thing. It is such a great and convenient thing I just wished they included it here atleast considering the price budget.2) Processor- It has the same exynos 9611 processor thats in their phone that cost around 11-12k . Come on Samsung why are u stuck on the same processor upgrade it there are several better option available.2) Build- It is a plastic body and is very slippery, so requires a cover ,which is not included in box.3) Screen around the front camera gets automatically and returns back to normal after sometimes, since it is a software bug I hope they fix it future updates , sometimes it stuck out and gets a little annoying.

  It is Tejas not Rafael.I don't understand why people giving it 5 stars !Camera image quality not as per my expectations.. I was using Moto G5plus 12 MP Camera and I was satisfied with its camera image quality. :-(Battery lasts for 1.5 day.I can not play IAF game in it.  :-(Processor slow - I feel.It is good phone for average daily use.

  So, it has been few days since I got my hands on Samsung Galaxy M31s, and I've got to say if you like media consumption on phone this is the best. Let me divide this into pros and cons.A. Pros  1. AWESOME DISPLAYI mean it when I say this has got an awesome display. The infinity-O sAmolled display is perfect for media consumption. Sure it has not got that high refresh rate that some Chinese phone makers and high end phones are providing, but the qualtiy of the display, is top notch. (Also like some infinity o displays out there this doesn't have any beading or halo effect around the camera cutout) 2. SINGLE TAKE IS SUPERBYou have to use this feature to get to know how good it is to have it on a phone. There are time when we want to capture a moment both in videos and photos (maybe with some filters) This feature let's you have that. It automatically captures the best photos and videos with just one shot. It's not as good as that in Samsung's flagship phones (just because they can capture using various lens and m31s uses its primary 64MP lens) 3. MONSTER BATTERY LIFEWell that's to be expected right? 6000mah should last you a full day with heavy load (like heavy gaming and media consumption) I had 15-20% remaining battery with heavy use. But mostly with semi-heavy gaming and usage the phone lasted me almost 2 days without charge. 4. WELL OPTIMISED PHONEM31s has android 10 with One UI 2.0 out of the box and it's a well optimised for apps and games. I have not faced any stutter or lag while using apps or playing games like pubg and codm. 5. 25W Super fast chargeSamsung provides with the flagship typec-type c Samsung 25W super charger inside the box. Thus it takes relatively less time to charge the huge 6000 mah battery. 6. Non-Chinese phoneSince boycott Chinese products is going on and most of the smartphone are made in China, this is a phone which is made in India so a good alternative.B. Cons 1. Plastic buildSince it's a plastic back it easily picks up scratches. So I recommend to use a case or a skin on this phone. (Case does not come with phone so you will have to purchase it)Well I don't have any more cons that I can think of. Yes it would have been good if Samsung upgraded the processor, but one UI 2 is well optimised for this particular processor so maybe that's why they didn't upgrade the processor.Basically M31s has a good screen, battery life, awesome camera, good fingerprint reader and is a excellent Samsung phone.

  Big thumbs up for this mobile. Looks great. Only draw back is battery not performing like 6000 mah. Hardly one full day with full battery. Everything else is perfect 5 star.Finger print sensor is lightening quick.UI experience is niceCamera is top notchI feel UI needs few more customizations within ONE UI itself. Case and screen guard should have included in the box. Battery size 6000 mah is eaten up by Exynos processor makes this phone battery offset. No advantage of having 6000 mah battery.I think this is going to be the last phone with these many features in sub 20k range. M51 is going to be sub 30k range for sure.Got this phone with exchange and it's a good deal

  Display is best in this segment. Its bright punchier colorsand great outdoor visibility. Deep blacks is perfect for movies. Sometimes i Miss high refresh rate screens but its ok to have such beautiful Amoled display.Camera is better now. Single take mode is fun to use. Night mode is now better than M31 and the best part is pro mode is back with shutter speed control. 4k front video is useful for bloggers like us. Selfie is good. The only thing i missed is telephoto camera. Syper steady is amazing.The exynos 7611 handles the phone quite well. But samsung should upgrade this to snapdragon or better processor made by samsung. UI is best much better than other phones. Its lag free and smooth. Everyday use is best on thisBattery is best best and best lasts more than 2 days with normal use and one day with heavy use. Screen on time is around 9 hours. And the best part is it has the same charger with Samsung provide with s20 series. So i can use my s20ultra with the same charger.Overall i can say its best in this segment if you dont need high refresh rate display but you want best battery life and beautiful vibrant display with better color accuracy then go for it

  though price great higher than m31 and most specs are similar to the its predecessor, I will prefer M31s to buy as it may sound more future proof. First the things i don't like and i know i am writing cons part first as besides it con part it is actually best phone with everything top notch in its real time usage.* Its processor, in day to day usage didn't find major lags or hang thanks to the great software optimisation with one UI through heavy usage and fast multi tasking might get difficult and i also notice it take more than usual time to power on.* i don't consider it as a con but it is heavy though weight balance is so good that you don't feel it is 200g+ phone* and last one , its about buying a 20k phone ans still not getting a phone case, screen protection and earphones is disappointing to be honest. for initial protection you need these things.* overall couldn't find more negative. i mean there are few small thing but i consider it as personal preference so no complain.some pros-* Its design and its build quality is top notch in the price range of 20k thanks to the added frame and back design.* Its camera department , display is the best* fingerprint scanner is fast though it is parallel to the frame you may need time to use to it.* it is waste actually waste of time to write positives and everything asides cons are great .to be honest i am completly satisfy with this phoneand last thing i prefer 6gb and 128gb varient as it is more value for money . OVERALL A BIG THUMPS UP.

  Its been a month. The M31s is working perfectly. Totally in love with it.The best Non-Chinese smartphone you can get in the market right now.I was fed up of Xiaomi phones.Pros:Looks daam premium.Display is the best one you ever see.Sound quality is also top notch.No ads in the UI.6000mah Battery works for 2 days.Camera quality improved than M31 and new features added.Cons:Only thing is, as the back panel has plastic glass, it gets finger prints attracted very fast. You will need to buy a back case to avoid this.

  The best phone Samsung has ever made in this price segment.1.Display makes this phone to compete with the high end flagships.2.Sony sensor is really an add back to this phone since it takes excellent pictures in daylight especially.3.Most reviewers had commented on the processor part that it is not a gaming one but my experience with this phone was different, tried PubG with ultra setting which worked very smooth and lag free.4. Battery perfomance is other thing which stands out and it last me 1.5 days with single charge.5. Fingerprint and Face unlock are insanely fast.The only drawback was samsung could have added a back cover and Screenguard with the box but what I did was ordered the cover along with the mobile.Overall I will rate 4.5/5 for this phone because this really adds a premium feel and experience.Hope this helps!

  Look wise an excellent product,looks better than m30s and m31, infinity o design looks premium and doesn't feel heavy.Rear camera is actually 16mp main shooter, give you 64 MP image by pixel binning technology excellent one,ultra wide is average, macro excellent.Front camera is actually 8mp gives you 32mp image, average in quality.Display is sAmoled excellent, very well visible in day light.Processor exynos 9611 good for routine tasks not great for gaming.Multitasking and ram management is good.Battery backup is excellent. Inspire of fast charger it takes enough time to charge to 100% due to its large size 6000mAh.Side mounted fingerprint sensor is good.Some software related issues are there which can be solved via an OTA update.Operating system Samsung one UI2.0 is good but missing many features like screen recording etc.Overall a very good deal during this independence Day sale.Of course I get a good exchange value for my one old mobile.If you are not a gamer definitely it's worth to buy.Major problem is its wireless Bluetooth connectivity, auto connect and disconnect frequently, Samsung fix this.

  Samsung m31s this is a super phone which never I have seen my life extraordinary battery life and extraordinary camera features and superb fingerprint reader fast and accurate than other phones in this phone Face Unlock is also so fast .In the box they didn't provide any case for the phone and no earphones for the phone but in a series they will provide a case and earphones and in the M series wild didn't provide case and earphones I don't know this is I was disappointed in Samsung M series so but the phone is superb and naturally grade in camera quality so perfect and I appreciate the Samsung offices to make a Sony sensor of 64 megapixel super phone in the 2020 year thank you for Samsung officers taking this phone to market

  I must say that my decision to wait for this phone was a right decision. When i ordered this phone, it was showing delivery on 20th Aug but i got this awsome phone well before that. I must say that this phone is really awsome, new style fast fingerpeint reader, awsome camera quality, fast charger. The phone is really value for money. 64 MP camera , the pics are so crisp and detailed. Pic colors are vivid and really superb quality.I give full marks to samsung Galaxy M31S and would recommend others if anyone planning to buy a mid range phone. I have come back to samsung after a long period, i must say Samsung has improved a lot.

  List of things that I noticed after using for 7days-1. Battery :- As per the mentioned specs the phone got a  massive 6000mah battery ?? but as per my usage it lasts hardly for a day ( I didn't try any game and mostly used  for stuff like taking online class ,watching YouTube videos and listening music) but the charger compensates it. It took 2 to 2: 20 hrs to fully charge( depends on condition )2. Camera:-The thing that disappointed me the most is the camera quality of the phone especially the front camera. The front camera is 32mp but the quality of camera is not as good as the no says . It cannot compete with with Chinese co. like Oppo and Vivo in terms of camera. During night even at decent lighting condition the photo it clicks appears to be blurry.White balancing of the photos is not accurate.Live focus is unable to clearly detect the edges of the photos.I previously had Vivo v15 having 32mp 1.5 yrs older whose camera quality is far better from this device which arrived later than that.3. Dark mode is awesome that at night we even cannot distinct the edges of phone and the screen.I loved it4.Design:- Design of this device is ?? ??5. Sound quality is decent6 Processor: Samsung should have provided better chipset than this.7.While I was taking class on Unacademy within 20mins it got heat up.8.Screen:- Screen is awesome,the s-amoled screen produces awesome colors and the viewing experience is great on this deviceHope samsung fixes the list of problems  I mentioned especially the camera capture during night through the next update

  Camera : too good. Pics cameout fantastic on all cameras(haven't checked night time performance but low light performance indoors was good) without any over-saturation or discontinuity/fading issue like similar priced oppo /vivo mobiles.Battery: slightly better than m30 and there's 25w fast charging. Almost 5 hrs of SOT on medium brightness n mixed use of media, browsing/shopping wifi.Screen: Its samsung. I don't need to say anymore.No lag of any kind seen since. The only cons i felt r the phone is on heavier side, exynos processor( u'll consider only if u Need to play pubg like graphic intense games on topmost settings)  and may be the fingerprintScanner position, fr some. I got used to it in a day but took my mom 3 days now she's ok with it.

  It's an absolutely fluid machine. Awesome sensors at the right place. Just wondering if Samsung would make profit by selling this phone at this price. I am sure they are limited quantity and would be taken off soon. The fingerprint sensor is very sensitive and responds with diligence. The great feature is its power-packed camera which not only has extremely powerful lenses, but blended with lossless software to encode it. Battery survives for 2 days, with extensive use for calling and listening to music. I am a lisztomaniac, so you may imagine. Thanks. Very contended.

  I'm updating my review after 20 days of use. Super display i love it. Great UI. Very good interface (smart switch app) from Samsung to transfer data from old to new phone, effortless. Camera is good, i hope it will improve with updates.I hate bloatware. I purchased 8Gb RAM version, but out of 8 gb, only half is available, it is irritating some times. I observed a bit of lag while playing mine craft. So, I must say that processor can be improved.Overall, good phone, considering non-chinese brand.

  Overall good  experience, my rating would be 3.5.Pros:1. Size : Good for movie & gaming.2. Camera : Very good, works exceptionally good in night mode.3. Look and feel : Vivid, typical samsung type.4. Pre- installed softwares: Limited and only required ones. good from security aspect.5. Weight : Feels heavy and when in pocket will definitely make u a feel that u are carrying something worth not losing.Cons:1. Phone heats up if used continuously for 30 mins for phone calls.2. Even video calls and you tube playbacks heats the phone near camera area. Pretty unexpected from an highend phone from Samsung3. Battery: Not a good performance as per 6000 mah. LAsts for a day with normal usage, i.e. phone calls, whatsapp, 1 hour youtube video, and some browsing. To be honest, i am disappointed on battery performance looking at its size especially when Samsung made it a big USP.4. Crux: You have better options in this price range, would recommend to try those instead of blowing 21,500 on this phone.5. Processor: Samsung has not done any big changes in its old Exynios Genre.Must go ahead..But Samsung has been a miser..did not provide  rear silicon cover.Charging cable length is just OK IN length.

  This is amazing value for money mobile, earlier i was using asus but changing mobile worth it.Battery: no worries charge within 1:40 hr, whuch is great compare to other mobiles.Camera:awsome, it captures what you needed.Screen :it's samsung USP it could never go wrong.Processor 9611: i also have some concerns before buying but it's not bad. many review available in internet saying processor is not good, but believe me i play lots of game (Pubg, COD, Asphalt, Mortal combat etc most game size 2.5 gb) , do not find any problem, only difference isduring first time game loading takes few seconds extra as compared to new processors.  So while playing no issue.Screen refresh rate: it's a myth 90 hrtz is better compared to 60, hidden fact is your eyes are only detecting 30 frames/hrtz, so your eyes are not even usung 60 hrtz frequency.Weight: yes it's slightly heavy bit do not hurt while typing or gaming, weight is well balanced.Protection: No comments, I always cover my mobile with screen gauard and back cover,  looks and sturdyness are also fine for me. But for this point you could count on other internet reviews, as i am playing safe with my mobile.

  I have recieved this mobile on 13th Aug, delivery well in advance. Mobile looks and features all looks superb. Suddenly on 21st august the mobile started giving advanced touch error and then screen gone off. Now the mobile display is off. Return window is closed on 20th Aug. Service centres are working only on limited days. I had to purchase a mobile immediately for my daily job. Samsung customer care also giving false information related to service centre. I go to office and find time only on saturday and sunday. Service centre is open only on monday, wed and friday that too with limited manpower. I purchased samsung mobile for the first time and now feeling bad about my decision. A latest mobile with limited application downloaded has suddenly crashed. Waste of my money.

  If you are not an heavy user then this phone is perfect for you but if you are a student, and  searching for a new smart phone this is not for youIn the first class you will find it perfect but as the class goes on and the 4 or 5 period came it wil start manking frame drops and lagsYou will notice an frame drops in animation while opening and closing of an app, or while switching between apps or in scrolling. I didn't know is the problem is in my device only or if the device is like that onlyI strongly not recommended you to buy this phone because its not able to handel the load of online classes then if you are a heavy user how will it survive in heavy usageAnd please don't trust on youtube reviews of this smartphone they are totally fake.And yaa its camera too its camera in low light condition is more useless then the sit of an dog

  I am facing two problems1. Fingerprint Sensor not so good as my previous  A6 Plus.2. Front Camara is shaking.Apart  from this Amazon packaging  is very  very simple  & bad.

  Received the phone today.  Inserted SIM.  Started phone.  Wi-Fi  problem couldn’t authenticate connection.  Reset whole Router with new SSID and Key.  Reconnected all other devices with new SSID and key including my old Redmi Phone.  All devices got connected except this brand new Samsung.Called Amazon Customer care.  They advised for a hard factory reset.  Did factory reset twice.  Still the same problem.  First impression is the last impression – May be Samsung hasn’t heard of it.  As of now they have allotted a technician to look into it.

  After using it for a week,in this price range definitely a good gadget.Touch,camera,processor speed,finger print sensor up to the mark.A lot has been said for the battery,it charges fast only if you off the net,location,keep phone on power saver than it charges in 90mins otherwise it takes 130 mins to charge,battery drains too quickly than M31.All other aspects are good,one can buy if don't want to go for Chinese one.
",,

  To begin with the phone is a complete package. Display gives an amazing experience, no doubt it's a battery monster coupled with 25 watt fast charging, reverse charging offers a great advantage, rear cameras give the best shots in the price segment, they add great variety also, front camera is good, the auto wide angle selfie feature is really handy, but sharpness can be improved. Single take is fun to use. Side mounted fingerprint sensor is really quick. It has Knox security but it's limited as it doesn't have secure folders and other A series features. Though made of plastic it still has a premium look and feel unlike the previous M series phones. Single mono bottom firing speaker is adequately loud but sounds a bit tinny at times. Dolby Atmos is present only for headsets and the music output is excellent. Processor is not made for gaming, hardcore gamers stay away. It's smooth and breezy for day today tasks. Multi tasking is no issue. OneUI 2.1 has excellent improvements over the previous versions. Call quality, network reception is absolutely fine. Internet download and upload speeds are quite satisfactory. Overall it's a great experience. Loved it

  Samsung has been giving the best amoled displays for quite some time now. This phone keeps up with the tradition. There is No 90 or 120 Hz refresh rate so yes that can be an argument as competition offers that.But then Samsung display is Samsung display. You just can't get wrong with it when it comes to watching videos.M Series is known for its battery, and the M31s delivers a punch here. Also, despite a beefy battery, phones ergonomics are pretty well handled and overall grip is comfortable (but sligthly heavy) thanks to back end curves.Phone looks and feels beautiful and the polycarbonate material build quality feels good but I don't intend to test it. Back is a finger print magnet.The Exynos 9611 SOC is good enough for less power hungry games but there is frame lag in certain games which demand graphics. Overall with 6000 mAh battery, a better optimization by 9611 SOC might have led to more than 2 day life, but no one is complaining.Call quality and reception is pretty good.Okay, the best part is Camera! Somehow Samsung has managed to fit a very very decent camera in to this one. Yes colors can be over saturated (5/10 times) but it's the same with most phones these days as perhaps the general public likes punchy colors.Video recording is pretty fine tooBut the winner here is the Night mode. Don't know what got into Samsung's head and they have accidently incorporated a very improved night mode for a M-series phone (less noise and better field of exposure). Its easily the best night mode in under 20,000/- category of phones.Even the 12 MP ultra-wide takes better pictures than other ultra-wides in daylight.Overall a good solid phone. Samsung is always guilty of over pricing (may be their screen costs more or whatever), but still would attract many. A price of 18000/- may just have killed the competition, but may be not this time.Disclaimer:I'm a very casual gamer, mostly see movies on Netflix and Amazon Prime video and so display and battery are my priority and the M31s doesn't disappoint here.Clear advantage is the camera, specially it's Night Mode.The 9611 SoC handles my daily routine well and 6GB RAM eases multi-tasking problems for the SoC. So didn't notice any lag in my experience so far.Min storage is 128 GB, and I really never needed more. You can always use a micro SD card to futher add storage.The review is based on my usage and i feel most of the crowd uses phone for social networking, web browsing and occassional gaming, so any basic SoC can handle it fine.

  The processor is pathetic, your phone would start lagging as soon as you start to use it. I had hoped that samsung one UI won't have many bugs but it has crucial bugs linked with speaker and mic that won't resolve after updates. Sound quality is okay for movies and stuff but pathetic for music. On top of that, Amazon won't accept returns and replacement is too much hassle. I'm used to buying literally everything online but that stops now. The only good thing with this phone are nice display and fingerprint and an average camera with bad camera app. If you can shell out a little more go for little higher end phones with better processor and never buy an Exynos

  Another well desinged model from Samsung M seriece with high capacity battery. Android 10 + Dark Mode best combination for Samsung display to viewPros-Design & Display The design of the mobile is awesome with 6.5 Inch Super Amoled Full HD display. Big screen to watch movies. The pixels resolution and smoothness of the screen is damn good. Nobody can beat Samsung in terms of dispaly. Glassy finishing at back side is too good. Edges and screen ratio is fine. Classy look. UI is awesome- Storage 6GB/8GB RAM is definitely huge, helpful for gamers, mutli purpose users. I didnt see any lagging or hanging till now while using. 128GB storage is lot to store-Battery Battery life is good. Lasting 24hours after more use, still 30% or 35% power will be remained.-Charger The charger cable is coming with Type C at both sides. Very fast charging 25W.  Reverse charge is provided in this model which is good option to lend some charging to others (Can use M31S as a powerbank :P)-Camera Came with new feature Single Take which helps you to capture realtime photos and video at the same time (Slow motion video, Fast Forward video, edited photos). Camera clearity is good and decent, Macro, Live Focus options will bring the creative photographer in you, but when I compared with Mi Cam I feel Mi cam sharpness is better-Processor Coming with Exynos 9611 processor. Works really fast and good without lagging.Cons- Since the size is big little bit difficulut to operate with single hand, but now a days it's not a big issue- Fingerprint scanner is not very accuarate, sometimes you may feel disgusting to unlock, even face lock also slow in response sometimes. Can be improved- Sound Quality is good but volume is not much- No indicator for notifications- Unncessary preinstalled Samsung apps- Ads on the screenPrice could have been set 18k as there is no much difference between M31 and M31S in terms of battery, processor, camera (Except Single Take). Must buy for Samsung Lovers

  Using it since last 3 days and nothing significant  o complain other than fingerprint sensor. I guess this is little pricey compared to China phones  especially  comparing to MI Redmi note series which are are almost 40% cheaper and slightly better. Nevertheless I purchased Samsung believing they have stringent quality  checks compared to Chinese.Cons:1) Fingerprint sensor located on the side is annoying since it is tricky to unlock when used with a TPU back case. I would have appreciated if the sensor was on rear instead which would have been very convenient  compared to side to use. Don't use any case if you want the fingerprint  sensor to be less annoying  or choose the ones having sensor only in the rear or indisplay..2) setting  up this phone Initially is very annoying  and consumes lit of time. God knows what updates it is updating in the background which seem i could not find3) Little pricey compared to MI redmi note series phones,  I was using redmi note7s  prior to this phone. The hardware is more or less comparable to MI redmi series phones which are available at much cheaper prices...I purchased Samsung and just avoided the temptation of Chinese  phones in respect to boycott..otherwise they are pocket friendly. Hope samsung reads this review and refund me and bring down the prices a little bit as wellPros:1) Samsung brand, assume completely made in india...not sure how many chinee components  are used though2) display and battery3) decent camera4) does not over heat during normal use

  So after using the M31s for more than 3 weeks, I have a mixed feeling about the device.Things I love about the phone:1. Display2. Clean UI3. Looks good compared to other M seriesThinks which are just Ok:1. The camera is identical to the older M31 and thus is underperforming.2. The battery isn't that monstrous as they claim. Felt like 4000 mAh. But still takes 3 hours and 40 minutes to get fully charged.3. External speakers are better than other M series but aren't good as most mid-rangers.4. Dolby Atmos audio failed to meet expectations as it is only good for enhancing the treble (Great help if you are old).Thinks I hate:1. Bulky and heavy. Feels like some walkie-talkies that I used to have during my childhood!2. Poor performance for this price! Can't even play games like Asphalt 9 without lags and frame drops.3. No option for random wallpapers with the One UI 2.4. Face unlock is pretty slow and thus is an obsolete feature!5. A slippery and plasticky body which acts as dirt and fingerprint magnet. Back of the phone is now full of scratch.6. The phone rebooted by itself 15 times in 22 days which is something scary for me!7. Unable to feel that Samsung signature, I can't explain why but feels like those Chinese brands on hand.

  Guys please beware. Worst ever phone from Samsung. Touch is of pathetic quality. Heavy phone and not user friendly. Very poor service from Amzon. Within an hour I am raising this for return, however No response from Amazon. Time to quit Amazon

  All featured specifications are up to the mark.Camera lovers.. highly recommend for you. #Intelli-cam, #Hyperlapse..But in this price segment, you could have expected Snapdragon 845 or 730G or a better processor in this phone instead of Exynos 9611.Good:•Excellent battery life, Monster 6000mAh.•Reverse charging.•Side mounted fingerprint sensor.•Crisp AMOLED display.•Bundled 25w fast charger.•Easy grip & sleek design.•Camera switching. Thumbs-up.• Has 3.5mm jack. (Thanksgiving)•Note like fealings to mid rangers. With PENUP support.Bad:•Doesn't offer earphones in the box. (Why samsung?)•Old processor.•No back cover included.•No clipboard for cut, copy & paste.•Major missing of important apps like Samsung Flow, Pass and Secure Folder* which you easily get in A Series.Glastic Back Panel is not so impressive when you pay Rs.21k+*Hope Samsung will fix and offer these in upcoming updates.

  Battery is discharging very fast. Its a worst  choice  to choose  dis phone. Thought  to hav a long battery  life. But its discharging  very fast.More over Amazon  asking to install a software to check the things. And dat software is not having battery option.Guys opt some other. Its useless.

  Screen is vibrant.Camera is good.Battery life is superb. One can easily get 2 to 2.5 days of battery on one full charge.One UI provided by Samsung is quite good. No lags or heating for day to day usage.25 watt charger. Reverse charging.Phone is not very heavy.Cons:Phone costs around 20000. Samsung should provide features like Samsung Pass in this phone.Panel is made of plastic. It get scratches very easily. One has to apply back cover to avoid this.No water resistant rating provided or mentioned.M30, M30s, M31, M31s all have same processor i.e.  Exynos 9611, which is based on 10nm. On other hand many cheaper phones are using 8nm processors which is more efficient. Samsung is charging good amount of money for some incremental changes.

  This is my 3rd Samsung Mobile. I was a big fan of Xaomi Redmi Mobiles, had 4 of them; I still am a fan, except for some performance issues, quality and other worrying issues with security, as its Chinese. Don't know when the updates stop as Xaomi stopped updates of its UI year after year for some 2-3 year old models too.Lately after purchasing Samsung Tab.. I am once again wooed and wowed by Samsung Quality & performance.Its SECURITY & PERFORMANCE that landed me here with M31S. I have no complains except for screenshot feature which is easy in Redmi & little cumbersome in Samsung, yet a 5* for everything from Samsung.  I admit and say that this M31S has a bundle of features to explore. The camera is very very impressive and pro mode is simply exquisite.

  Georgius, awesome!It is powerhouse of battery, camera, processer and smooth fabulous display. It is better than other China's smartphone in this price.

  Happy to switch to samsung phones from all other chinese phones i owned previously.Samsung has inbuilt device care app which manages the ram and saves battery and puts apps to sleep when not required. You also get samsung max premium VPN service for free although you will have to select the premium service from samsung max app bcz by default basic service is selected for everyone. Kindly note bcz the VPN is free its slow. Comes with Dolby atmos feature but ya dolby atmos can only be used with headphones and works with Bluetooth headphones too. What I liked about samsung is the dolby atmos feature provided is not there for show it really works amazing when you listen to real dolby atmos content using headphones on the phone . For me I am satisfied with this phone

  Pros: -In hand feeling is great with unique gradient look.-The cameras of this one is just amazing. Photography might become ur hobby with the ultimate quad camera setup in this device.- Fingerprint sensor is modern and works really well.- Super amoled display and the speakers with punchy sound gives a completely different experience with the multimedia.-25 watts charger is the cherry on the cake.Cons:-A back cover could have been provided because the back is a fingerprint magnet.- A bit advanced processor could have made this phone an asset worth possessing (Only for hard core gamers).Conclusion- Being a moderate user, I am really happy with this Samsung device. It's a big competition to any other smartphones in this range in the market at this point of time.

  Aesthetics :First of all the phone is very good to look at. The glossy finish on the back of the phone where the colours merge looks good. The one down side is back side of the phone is a finger print magnet and be ready to invest in a good back cover for the phone. It would be good if samsung provides a good cover in the package for the phone as they are providing for some models in the m series.Camera:The phone has good camera on paper and lives up to its expectations in the real world. in well lit scenario it provides very good results. The low light scenario is really challenging even for the top of the line phones. This phone is also no exception in low light scenario I see a bit of noise and loss of detail.Battery Backup:The big thing about the phone is the battery and it is able to hold the battery for two and half days of normal usage.Software Updates:One thing I remain skeptical is how long samsung will provide software updates, I think it is for 2 years but I would be happy if get for 3 to 4 years.Conclusion:So, if you are looking for a good phone under Rs.20000 this is a phone that will and should be in the first three places in your list of phones.

  It's not about giving review, it's about sharing my experiences with someone who need to buy this from hard earned money. I don't share my mobile picture because its my whole thing now.Why you have to buy this?1. Mobile look is awesome.2. Performance is really good, behind my expectation.3. Side finger print sensor is working than what you think, meanwhile faceunlock also working soo good.4. Battery stands upto 14hrs rough use, but I'm not try it more than twice.5. Edge to Edge perfection in screen looks and handy to use.6. Don't worry about price because Samsung 25W get know you it's perfect.7. UI 2.1 gives you different experience.8. PUBG is really working equal to other competitors.So why you should not buy this1. If you want a 5G network don't think about this mobile.2. Signal strength is not improved like other M series mobile, I feel its have to look by samsung.3. Battery save mode ( Medium power saving) not perfect as I seen before.4. Faceunlock consumes more battery.Don't confuse by review if you want a mobile classy, good performance and updated trend choose this because it has everything. Expect 5G.

  Feels good to hold. It is a plastic body but still seems quite premium.The camera is good. Not a flagship so  ant expect much. But a lot better than my  previous samsung s8. The single take feature is a load of c**p. Or maybe I haven't used it efficiently yet.Battery backup is simply awesome. Don't.  Have to keep plugging in. But again the 25w fast charging is a load of c**p. My previous moto g6 had 18w turbo charger and that worked a lot better. Though that battery capacity was low as well. But gave me equivalent backup.Screen is the best part. It's beautiful, huge and crisp with minimal pinhole obstruction. Good colour saturation and brightness. Face unlock is just a tad bit slow. Fingerprint sensor is a bit of an issue. New position at the side on the unlock switch but more importantly it is not the most responsive

  Bought the 6Gb/128Gb Mirage Black variant..- Battery does not feel like 6000 mAh just one day max with medium to robust usage..- Camera is good but the 64MP feels like some 16/32MP..Macro lens also not upto the mark..- Only good thing is display in S-AMOLED..which is again a common thing in all of samsung's mid range smart phones..so not a big deal- Issue with network as wellI simply din understand how a flagship level phone which created soo muchhh hype in the market turned out to be a big S###..Samsung just foxed the customers taking the ongoing anti-china emotion into their advantage..JUST A BIG THUMBS DOWN FROM MY SIDE...

  Although i was super excited for the product, but after receiving it i was little disappointed for the camera.The camera is not upto the markThe front camera looks like 16mp only and clicks smudgy pics. Plus you have to keep your hand super stable otherwise it clicks blurry pics.The plus point of the phone is it's built quality. Does not looks like it has 6000mah battery. Plus the display is also very good. The side mounted fingerprint button click is not so good, but okk.The processor is really bad, not very smooth.

  I am a oneplus user. I just bought this for my mom usage. I have been using it for week. After the present situation  of against the made in china products. I just blindly  booked Samsung after gone through  some reviews in YouTube.Totally waste of money. U will find lags in each animation. I regreat for my worst decision  ever.Dont buy if u are looking  for a good product.

  Simply brilliant! I definitely think this is the best phone to buy if one has the budget of about 20K. The battery is long lasting, the cameras are better than any other phone in its category and the screen is magnificent.The only little glitch is the fingerprint scanner on the left of the phone. It can be really uncomfortable for people with small fingers. And it isn't as responsive as it should be. I had to press at least  twice to unlock the phone. Maybe I am a bit too casual with my touch, but its definitely an issue.However, besides the above minor issue, I think this is a brillphone by Samsung for people who want to have a good viewing experience,  a great set of cameras and a long lasting battery.

  Excellent photos with Sony IMX682, But low light captures are very poor. Battery is good, can manage two days with normal usage. A bit laggy while playing multiple games Simultaneously with 6 GB RAM. Anyways the screen is super amoled which is pretty much common in samsung devices, watch movies with super quality when compare with Chinese mobiles in this range.

  All good. Comes preloaded with some 3rd party softwares, that was a bit irritating but all can be uninstalled. Great value for money though. Battery lasts full 24 hrs with heavy bluetooth usage with my earbuds and wireless ON all the time. Takes around 1.5 hrs to charge completely. It has Knox security but remember, it's not water proof so be cautious in rain and near pools, tanks, bathroom, etc. Feeling on screen is good. Great with multiple apps open at the same time. Do not forget to put TPU cover or armor guard with some screen guard. My friend dropped his 2 days old M31s from half a meter height and screen is shattered and gone black completely.  I think original screen replacement from the authorised service center is 8.5k. Better safe than sorry. Worth every penny for this price. I bought in prime day sale so got 1500/- additional discount.

  This is perfect for day to day usage with fantastic camera quality. There is no full version of Knox security. Processor is not for high gaming. Battery is descent but you can get 5830mah like battery life because of this processor.Display is awesome.And there is a hidden app lock system with samsung max app for data saving and privacy protection.Fingerprint sensor is very fast but face unlock is secure.There is a unique single take feature.And it is a non Chinese  phone.Build quality is awesome.Big screen bright writing  is very helpful for students.

  I booked M31s on 6th August 01 AM but it's deliver to me on 15th August, almost after 10 days. It's came to me with my another ordered medical oil in a single outer box and mobile box is damaged. U can see the box photographs.Such a valuable products coming along with a oil bottle. This is ridiculous delivery experience by amazon seller.Except photography and display nothing is special to me after 3 days using experience. UI is not up to the mark. Advertisement is coming on screen while calling. Battery is 6000 mah but not getting service like 6000 mah. No screen guard or PU back cover inside the box. Finger print sensor is just ok not super fast. Body is plastic and definitely u will face the scratches issue. Price should be under 17K is perfect for this phone. I'm using 6/128 GB variant.Will update after using 1 month.

  Pros - This phone has monsterous 6000 mah battery, reverse charging and Samoled display. Coming about single take camera make this phone more interesting and look wise make this phone best under 20k.Cons - only con is processer. Exynos 9611 since 2 yrs samsung is using this processor in mid rangeOverall pubg is running smoothly because of optimization
",,
"
  Lets talk about the cons first.. the front camera struggles in low light, due to the charging cable being type c to type c.. one cannot use it as a data cable which is a little annoying. There is no TPU case or screen guard applied with the phone which makes the phone little more vulnerable and so we have to spend some extra bucks to get to that security.Pros are more than cons. The rear camera is really impressive, night mode too adds to its advantages, the front camera works like magic in good lighting condition. If we turn off the skin smoothness and beauty mode, it produces some good details. Battery life and the charging time is decent. Display is extraordinary. Sound is rich and loud. Don't worry about the processor, if you are not a gamer who streams and plays for hours, it is a perfect phone for you. It works lovely . Moreover it comes with Knox security.

  A Very Big Samsung Mobile Fan.First of all, loved the new Glastic design and the side-mounted fingerprint sensor which is very fast.A Very massive battery and the Amoled Display puts a cherry on the cake.The 64 MP intelli-cam is just Lit????.The new infinity O display in M series was a great idea.The sim slot is also very unique.Currently using the Samsung M30s, M21, M31s. All of them are great considering their price point.Attached some of the Camera samples.Loved the Knox security in M-series.Reverse charging is a very useful feature.The 25W charger is also awesome.The image processing is awesome and very fast.

  It is a very nice phone. Loved the always-on display. It's a very large and good display. I am playing casual games. The sound is loud. The battery life is good and fast charging helps to fill it quickly. There was no breakage for me on the Bluetooth front, I am pairing my Sony XM3 with this and I am not an audiophile but Dolby Atmos makes a nice hearing experience for me (XM3 is not Atmos-certified). The camera is also good enough for me (it has Sony cameras). I am not a pro photographer and ultimately all my photos are uploaded to google, so good enough camera for me. So it is a very nice purchase for me. And I hope every person buying this phone (instead of buying Chinese brands) have the same experience. Also do always buy insurance for your phone for at least the first year. I have seen many cases when it comes handy coz you never know when an accident (only to your phone) happens.

  Picked up the phone for my mom. Went for samsung as I didn't want to buy a phone manufactured by a Chinese company, if not would have definitely gone for xiaomi.Great phone. Loved every thing about the phone except the plasticky feeling of the back cover. Felt like I wasnt holding a  phone that costs around 20,000 ?. Have redmi 8a dual and must say that the over all build quality of redmi 8a dual, which cost me around 7000/-? when it was launched, is better, at least the phone feels sturdy.Otherwise m31s is great phone. Camera and the picture quality great. The phones responsive. The finger print scanner at the side is a refreshing change.Would have rated it 5 if not for cheap plasticky feeling of the phone.

  Very bad expirience with Samsung as a company, I am a doctor who is dependant upon mobile so my patients can contact me at any hour. I had xiomi note Pro 7 working fine, due to china border problem ( being patriot) I decided to spend 20000 rs on samsung M31s and I did. On 26 th night sometimes my phone went blank,I came to know when my emergency covid patients relative  came knocking on my door at 4 am accusing me of putting off my phone which I did not do, Samsung m31s did. After working tirelessly for 25 yrs and even in pandemic I was accused of being careless thanks to Samsung. I have lost my patient reports, was not reachable, went to service station exposing myself to 20 people as Samsung has no social responsibility of maintaining social distancing in 80 Square foot space.I am throwing all my samsung things and will not ever buy anything from Samsung anymore and I advise everyone the same.Thanking youDr Sameer

  Wifi signal reception is too week as compare to Mi mobiles. Battery gets discharged bit faster than Mi mobiles.HOTSPOT signal strength is weaker than Mi Note 5 Pro.I would say Samsung must use better hardware if selling these mobile more costlier than redmi and other Chinese brands who are giving better hardware in less cost.I would not suggest to buy this phone regriously.Within a month of use, it has started HANGING even on basic apps opening, processor is not capable to handle basic process and apps.. DISAPPOINTED from SAMSUNG again.

  Samsung Galaxy M31s is the latest offering from Samsung India in the M series of smartphones. Samsung Galaxy M31s is an excellent smartphone and will highly appeal to all Samsung fans in India. With an excellent camera setup which has many intelligent features, the camera enthusiasts will simply love this phone. The only thing that should have been upgraded by Samsung in this phone is the processor which should have been more powerful. The 6GB RAM 128GB storage variant costs ?19,499 and the 8GB RAM with 128GB storage variant will cost ?21,499. All in all, this phone is still highly recommended. Check out my full review on my YouTube channel with the same name.

  I ordered this phone before one month.Its working fair enough and having no any issues at that timeBut after one month its start giving headache.Dont trust on Battery capacity of this phoneI put phone in charge and when its fully chargedBattery percentage falling to 0% in 4-5 hours without even using phone.Fast charging is also not working nowSo i don’t recommend this phone.Go for any other brand or model but dont spend 20,000 for 2 months.

  I've gone with this phone for the brand value which samsung carries. The important highlights of this phone are as follows :-Pros ----1- Design2- Look and feel3- Screen quality and colours4- Fantastic cameras5- Small notch with minimum bezzelsCons :-1- Moderate Processor Exynos 9611 which is available in M21, M31, M30s. Which is not suited for heavy usage, apart from that it works fine.2- Back pannel attract a lot of smudges-------I've attached a few camera samples

  I have used it for 4 days and i feel for the price,  its a wonderful device . Even though you will get a mobile with better specs from Chinese manufacturers in the same price range  but thats the trade off you need to bare if u want a non Chinese phone keeping  in mind the privacy and data of users .Let us look into the pros of this device- 6.5 inch s amoled screen  is dope , colors are too vibrant . I think this is the selling point of this device.-battery is 6000 mah and coupled with 25 w fast charger its insane . It takes little more than 2 hours to fully charge and lasts more than a day .- samsung UI is refined and comes with many features  .- camera is too good ,you will get clear and vibrant pics .- side mounted finger print scanner is ergonomically  placed.Few cons which I have noticed are- processor is weak , they should have upgraded it for the hardware they are providing  .- its good for day to day usage , works pretty fine but not for heavy gaming- although phone is not slippery but they should  have included a cover with the device .

  Not as expected. Don't go for fast charging which is one of the slowest. Big battery has not made any difference. I was using phone which was using low battery but still used to get same usage time as i am getting on 31s. Charging takes more than double the time my earlier phone used to take. Photos looked OK. Finger print reader is absolute waste. Nothing more to tell as of now. Not at all worth for money. I waited and bought this as wanted to buy non Chinese, but completely disappointed. Adding - ctakes lot of time if charged from car charger. Even 1% increase takes hell lot of time. Other phones get charged 10 - 15% by thr time this phone charging increases by 1%.Don't know what to do. Samsung this is not good.

  Phone is not usable on speakerphone, your voice will not go to second party due to mic issue. Very poor noise cancelation, its basically a voice cancelation. This is my last purchase of samsung. They lost the trust for quality. Now we will switch to other brand.Processor is slow!No feel of having 8GB RAM. Apps loads at same speed as 3GB RAM.Overall quality is average.Disappointed this time with samsung purchase,Color contrast is not as a premium phone amoled.Speaker lacks.At speakerphone, mic does not capture audio properly.Battery life is good. Cameras are average.Fingerprint is impressive..Overall phone is slow in speed rest is ok.

  I have used this phone for a week.Pros:1. Fast charging2. Battery3. Camera4. Finger print5. Good fit in the handCons:1. Poor default launcher2. Speed isn't great3. This gadget should have been around 17.5K.4. Build isn't strong.5.  Missing screen recorder.6. On the fly call recording option is missing.

  I have been using this phone for a month now (6gb ram, 64gb rom variant) and here is my review:1. Build: The build is entirely plastic but does not feel cheap in hand. The gradient design at the back makes it real cool.2. Screen: The screen is one of the brightest and vivid. The colors come out really well and don’t  make the phone appear as a budget phone anytime. The media viewing is actually awesome.3. Battery: I take around 50-60 calls in a day; watch media for 2-3 hours. The battery lasts me the entire day (8am-9pm) and then I have to put it on charge again with 20% battery still remaining. The charger provided is 25w which takes almost 1.5 hours to charge the phone completely.4. Camera: The cameras are really good, especially the output from the primary on the rear one. The pictures are bright with good details in daylight. I also find the night mode to be better than most other phones at this budget. The selfie snapper is 32 mp with good images in daylight; the images appear soft and grainy in low light however.5. Software and performance: This is where the lag comes into play. The device is powered by a age-old exynos processor. I have felt stutters while using apps like youtube and whatsapp. When I minimise the youtube window and again go back to reopen it, sometimes I get only the audio with no video playing. Similarly sometimes whatsapp freezes while I try to take a picture. However, I think these are minor issues and can be fixed through software updates. All other apps run well. I am not a heavy gamer but games like subway surfers, ninja warrior run without any lags.6. Network and call: I have noticed many call drops and voice issues. The 4g connectivity is also not very stable (I use airtel). These again can be addressed through software updates.Overall it is a great budget phone with few software issues. This is the phone for you if you are on a budget of less than 20,000 bucks and a light to moderate user.

  Camera quality is very bad. Very disappointed....

  The Exynos 9611 processor in this phone doesn't affect its performance experience in-person. You'll barely notice any performance lags in day to day tasks. Don't stick to spec sheet comparisons, you'll barely notice the difference in performance while using it side by side with other phones. It is a very solid and beautiful phone. Full charge in 1 Hr 45 min which is quite fast considering 6000 mAh battery. The screen is beautiful and cameras are great.'About phone' section shows it has Knox security but I don't understand why it doesn't have a secure folder option and any other option. Knox is there but I am confused about its purpose.Also, UI is scaled down and doesn't have a 3 finger gesture screenshot, no screen recorder, no edge lighting, and no Gcam support. Other than that everything is superb especially no bloatware and ads, unlike Chinese counterparts. Also, it has very good privacy control options. Also no issues in call reception and signal.

  I like the phone for a lot of things considering the price point it falls in. I use samsung S10 as my second phone and despite a bit bulkier than that because of the battery size, I like the touch sensitivity, the screen quality and crispness of the display and the touch sensitivity despite applying a screen guard.The battery lasts almost 1.5 days and the phone does not tend to hang. I use it as my office phone and Light gaming, so the screen real estate makes it easier to use the phone. I also would say that samsung has done a commendable job with the software, UI and there are a host of useful features similar to the high end S Series.... I find the earpiece sound to be quite loud and the speaker to be 3.5 on 5.You can go ahead and buy this phone if you are looking for a budget device that satisfies most of your requirements.

  Not at all happy with this phone from a reputed company. On the 10th day after purchase, I had kept it for charging in night and in the morning saw the screen to be blank and unresponsive. Took it to the service centre and they said the screen has broken due to fall. I felt that it was on the bedside table and may have fallen due to my movement in my sleep so asked them to repair it. The service personnel said that it is a new launch so parts are not available and he doesn't know how long it will take. I have still left it at the service centre and it's been a week, haven't heard from them.Most surprising thing is that Samsung says it has Corning gorilla glass 3 and Corning claims it to be scratch and drop resistant. But if thephone fell in my sleep from the bedside table which is 22 inches high and screen broke then all claims are false. It even had a screen guard installed. My several other phones have fallen many times but never broke. I will never ever buy a samsung phone again.Others should also think before investing their hard earned money in these times.

  After all the smartphone from samsung this one came out to be all rounder at mid range category. Except processor, which is having a decent performance, everything is fine. Looks is good, light weight, good camera, great display. Battery drains bit faser considering it has 6000 mah battery and S Amoled screen, expect this to be resolved in future updates. If you love photography, specially pro mode then go for it, it has impeccable pro mode the iso works the same way as dslr. See the shot attached. You will hardly find any noise. Low shutter speed with tripod give you amazing result. I love this phone because of its camera.

  I was very happy with my purchase, because I found this phone after doing a lot of research on the Internet comapring a lot of mid range phones. The 'M' series provide very very promising specs at their price points and even Samsung's own 'A' series starts at a price point ?10000 higher for a similar specs phone in the 'M' series.What went wrong is that my phone's touchscreen went unresponsive on it's own about 7-8 after the phone arrived and i couldn't get a replacement from Amazon because of their ''7days'' return poilcy. And surprisingly I couldn't even get a replacement from the official several Samsung service centres, because they prompted me that ""The M series phones are malfunctioning quite a lot and replacement parts for this series is not being supplied by Samsung "". So i decided to get a refund coupon that could sadly be applied at ""Samsung Brand Offline Stores"" only!. So I ended up purchasing a Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite as an upgrade, because the Samsung 'A' series line-up is just so stupid, having the same specs as 'M' series and being ?10000 costlier.

  Using from 5 days, Satisfied with the phone so far! Here's a real user review from my end:********Pros********•Premium AMOLED Display! enhances your streaming experience.•6000 mAh marathon runner with Fast juicing capacity of 25W•Fingerprint accurate & Fast•Cameras give excellent output for a regular user. For Camera Geeks, you have a plethora of features out there!•On Performance, it's snappy in day to day usage. Though not 90Hz, its touch response is smooth and it adds to performance!********Cons********•Graphic intensive Games like PUBG might lag!I've played PUBG, it performs smoothly upto 1hrs or when you play in Solo/Duo/TDM, But when you play with Squad, phone heats up a bit after 30 mins, lags & shows stutters on prolonged gaming!In simple, its for those who chill out with friends & not serious gamers!•Other cons: No major issues noticed, Will edit when I see one!*******Verdict********Who should buy?•It's perfect for those who then owned a 2yr old Mid-range/Budget Device or 1yr old Budget device! Someone who've used flagship earlier will be disappointed!•For those who don't game everyday•For those who want Camera ready phone giving best pictures!•For those who watch a lot of content, it might be a Mid-range device but a Flagship in Display!

  Writing this review after few weeks of usage:Pros:1) Display: Probably one of the best display in this price range. Outdoor visibility is good, display is bright and vivid.2) Battery life: It truely lives up the hype of its battery. It's monster battery easily gets you a day with heavy usage and continuous usage and few time on gaming.3)Performance: The overall performance is excellent for day to day usage. Handles routine multitasking with ease. So far I haven't tried any heavy end games but I'm preety sure it can handle it with ease. Samsung is giving regular updates to make UI work smoothly.4) Camera quality: It is it's strength as well as bit of weakness. Overall general photography is good. You get a good color reproducibility in day light with Standard camera. In wide angle mode, image quality decrease and image tends to be over saturated at times. Night mode is okiesh but not great in extreme low light conditions. Selfi camera does great job for selfies and also for group selfies. Samsung has added lots of features in camera app to overshadow the shortcomings of camera in this phone. 64MP is just a number, don't fall for it. Regular 16MP mode shoots photos mostly upto the mark of most of the people. Overall Camera is not the best but above average for this price range.5) Fingerprint reader: Well it's fun to use. It's very precise and haven't been able to fool it yet, so feeling relaxed ??. But accidentally you tend to unlock the phone though you don't want to. But with routine usage, you'll learn how to avoid it.Cons:1) Weight: With this huge battery inside it, the phone weighs heavy. If someone has habit of putting it in upper pocket of shirt, it will be difficult for day to day handling.Overall, it's more than a value for money phone and a definate upgrade over M31. Go grab one for yourself.

  It is only  non Chinese brand. Other than not value for money.Fingerprint reader works well.Battery life is good enough.Camera quality is not comparable with my very old phone Gionee Elife E8(2015) and Nokia N8(2010). It is laggy and not delivered sharp photos as my old Phone. So I have to wait for Google Pixel 4a. Samsung Galaxy M31s actually made for modern girls(slim design and beauty cam). I am not a gamer nor so much app user. But I've noticed this mobile is laggy. In every time when I open Google Photos in my high speed wifi, it takes much time than my 5 years old gione elife e8(3gb ram). Who have this mobile they will agree with me. Because my mobile (Samsung Galaxy M31s) is not defective, it is OK condition.  But it has limited capability and capacity which is not worthy for this price segment.

  Have been using this phone for a week ans I must say its quite impressive,  key feature of this phone is charging speed,  it charges from 0 to 100% in about 1 and 1/2 hour which is pretty fast considering the massive battery size- The 64 mp camera works flawlessly-The fingerprint scanner is placed very well, it detects almost 8 out of 10 times accurately and is very fast- A great phone for a regular user , the speed with which all apps open up is incredible- The hidden  feature of Transcribe lets you type a statement in a documented format as you say, which is a great feature for students and office goers- Lastly, the front facing camera is superb and the multi foto features saves your lot of time while taking photographsIssues that I have with this phone- No back cover included in the package- No clarification about the Knox Security as mentioned on the phone- Polycarbonate back cover, please replace it with Gorilla Glass protection( it gives a premium feel to the phone)- Battery drains a bit faster compared to M30s

  My review after using this pgone in all aspects.I am using this for last 3-4 days.Excellent camera - Good low light photography. 64 Megapixel does its work. Inteli Cam is just awesome.Display is Superfine even in direct sunlight it works Excellent. Touch is just Excellent.Phone looks really cool in hands. UI is good. Speaker sound is good. Phone charging time is little bit higher. Battery backup time would be better.Overall it's a very nice phone.

  In the box contents:1. The phone2. Type-C to Type-C data cable3. 25 Watt fast charger brick4. A SIM ejector pin5. A user guideAbout the device:Looks:I bought the mirage black and it looks more premium than it actually is with all the gradient finish on the back.The front looks absolutely fantastic with the BIG 6.5 Inch super AMOLED display which looks gorgeous.The tiny hole punch camera on the top middle of the screen is so tiny that you wouldn't even notice that the hole exists sometimes.You get a 3.5 mm headphone jack, Type-C USB connector and a speaker at the bottom.The volume button and the power button is on the right side of the phone and they are reachable.The fingerprint sensor is embeded into the power button and it works just fine.Performance:The overall performance is great, deals with the daily tasks with no issues.The 6000 mah battery is a champ and you can easily get through a heavy day with 40% battery remaining in the phone.The talking point here is the display of the phone. With the ppi over 400 the quality of the display is absolutely fantastic. For media consumers this is a gift and the massive battery combined you can go on and on watching your favourite shows on this beautiful display.Coming to the charger it is 25 Watt and it comes IN-THE-BOX which is GREAT!The charger will take the massive 6000 mah battery from 0 to 100 in about 1 hour and 50 mins which is great and enough for most of the people and the back-up you get from it is good too.Overall:Great phone for daily use and content consumption with great display and great battery life.If you are looking for a phone for gaming I wouldn't recommend this. But otherwise you can just buy this phone with no doubts what so ever!!

  It is the best M series smart phone till now by samsung. The camera quality is awesome(both front and back), expecially i liked the micro 5MP camera. (Attached sample shots )Other camera features like ONESHOT is quite amazing and gives a premier feel. Overall camera quality is very good having the sony sensons. The amoled display by samsung is fantastic. Figerprint scanner is quiet responsive but it could have been a bit faster. And the last thing is the Huge Battery with long batterg life. For moderate use the battery last for around 1.5-2 days, which is amazing. For heavy users it last for a day.Very Satisfied and Happy with the product. And one of the best in Price.

  Purchased it as a gift for my wife. Looks, build and performance is excellent. I myself have  S10+  but  comparing the price ranges of both these Samsung Models, Galaxy M31S is a better choice. Its battery is still showing 25 % even after 72 hours ( moderate use )  where as S10 lasts only 24 hours.  Delivered much before the expected date.  Earphones , not included in the package is disappointing.  Fast charger is great. Biometric scanner on side home button is not convenient. NFC is also a miss. Cameras are excellent .Overall a  five star deal. Thanks Amazon.PS Please take care while buying covers for this model. People are selling  M31/M31s covers As compatible  but there is size difference of .1 inch in these two models.

  After using 15 days, I can say this is a perfect device to battle with Chinese phones in 20k-25k range.This is best choice to one who loved ?  brand name with good features and in reasonable price.Pros,Camera- with sony sensor (gives quality pictures)Display- super amoledBattery- 6000Design- premium lookCons,Fingerprint sensor- slower (sometimes doesn'trecognize your finger)Processor- 9611 (very slow browsing experience)And that screenshot option really bad, need to try 4 to 5 times to get it done. Hope samsung will chage it in next update.But I'm satisfied with above because it have many good features with brand name and I don't want Chinese phone.

  After going through specifications and youtube videos of many brands of mobiles (i let off all chinese makes) I zeroed on Samsung M31s. I had to wait a month as it sold like hot cake on launch day. Now that I have got it in my hand, I am really happy. It has 64 mp camera, 6000 mah battery and it charges so fast with new C charger at 25 w. It is handy and not to much weight. It has wireless calling facility too. One thing which gave me tension was the low audio volume of incoming calls. Suddenly i started worrying about my hearing capability. Then went through the settings and found that the default volume was kept for under 30 years old. May be the mobile took me to be one below 30 years and I am happy about that too. But my  Ears were not happy. Then Eureka !  I found here is a facility to personalise the audio volume too. This I am posting because  in  many  elderly persons face  with this hearing problem.Cons-------The  inward audio is kept on top but sometimes give trouble particularly when you have mobile  back cover. Same way face recognition is not very successful.

  Decent for day to day use but with some irritating issues and some useful functionality miss.Phone has a powerful battery, no doubt about that. Where my earlier phones with 3200 mAh battery used to drain twice a day, this phn doesn't break a sweat it easily lasts for 1.5 day. Although 6000mAh battery increases the weight of the device significantly.Look, Display and design of the phone are amazing. Looks good at both front and back. Gradient bacl gives phone a premium lookMemory management : Samsung does not live up to expectations here. I was using a 6GB Realme 3 pro before this but never had  my phone freeze or hang, but this ""Monster"" by Samsung is not so good to handle applications, I have seen high RAM consumption and device do hang sometimes which is quite irritating given it being an 8 GB memory phoneFingerprint sensor : probably most impactful irritating thing with this phn is the side button fingerprint sensor. It is not very smooth, takes time, since surface area is small, finger misses it many a time, and sometimes if my finger touches it while picking up the phone it gets disabled for 30 seconds or so. Surely never going for side button sensor ever again.Camera: Ohh the biggest disappointment. From the setup which it boasts of quality of pictures is not up to the mark. Night mode is not the best in segmentMissing Utility apps: When some companies are offering many utility features that can be useful, this phone lacks such features . Team can research by looking at some other phones and introduce new features to increase utility.So by the overall review it is not a phone I would buy if I had any non-China product with decent reputation. But since we do not have any other option I think it is a phone I can live with. Hopefully we will have better Indian players in this segment and then we can have some improvements

  The product is nice from its price prospective. Samsung has really gone ahead since last year pushing lot of features in its One UI which also looks great with its AMOLED display. In terms of display I think currently non of the other brands/neither its own predecessor are in competition with Samsung. The phone looks premium because of its glasstic appearance and a slight curve around the front pannel nevertheless the material is rightly said as plastic. Careful selection of tempered glass is essential as to protect the screen. The battery seems to be preety good. Started setting up the phone with allmost 50% took around 5 to 6 hours to complete setting up the phone and the battery was still at 46% and after allmost a day later it is at 38%...quiet impressive. But have to bear in mind even it's bunduled with a 25W fast charging adapter it will take atleast 60 to 120 minutes to fully charged. Let's move to sound, I think the speakers are ok ok type as you maynot feel the quality bit distorted, however with nice set of headphones along with Dolby Atmos plus UI sound settings the sound quality is nice. Moving to the next segment front camera, I felt it could have been improved with indoor shots you can easily she the selfies are whitewashed, there are ampule of options to edit but the major part is how the original image appears, so I am not quiet impressed with front camera. Primary camera is nice indoor shot was good. Need to try with night mode.

  I love the phone barring the below cons1. Due to processor the UI lags sometime2. No case or screen guard in the box3. Screen gets scratched easily without screen guard may be due to Gorrilla Glass 34. No samsung features like Alt Z available only core variant of One UI given5. Wifi speed are less not sure why.Pros1. Excellent Screen for media2. Good Battery life as due to processor getting only 7 hours screen on time. But the SD counter parts are getting same even with 5000mah battery3. Fast FP sensor4. 25w charger5. 3.5mm jack

  1.Best budget phone under 20k throughout any brand..best thing is its non chinese unlike those fancy companies..Superb camera quality, superb Portrait shots2.Battery life doesn't seem like 6000mah..ita last 1 day easily with moderate to heavy usage3.Screen is that thing which anyone will fall for..feels like a RO water display so much detail so much crisp. Movies with a earphone or good quality sound box feels like theater at home4.selfie is not that great ok ok tye5. Always on display feels Premium6. Daily normal usage feels buttery smooth unlike the gaming in it.7. Main problem is Internet, i feel internet runs slower than other devices8. As my title Little compromise so the compromise is its processor..Too much outdated now..now 7nm processors are coming and samsung still using Exynos 9611 10nm architecture processer which is a little disappointing.. rest is good9. Back panel feels extremely premium if u don't use the back cover but a back cover is recommended for long term premium fit and finish.10. Fingerprint reader fails 6/10 times if u don't set ur finger properly  Don't overthink just buy this phone u will never ever regret this deal for upcoming 1-2 year.. Good luck

  The moment I unboxed this amazing phone, I was in awe of how it was made. It's amazing at all the aspects Samsung boasts. First off, I'd like to tell you about the processor, the Exynos 9611 chip, it's one of the finest from Samsung and is also found in it's more premium and high range 'Galaxy A Series' like the Galaxy A50 and more. Secondly I'd like to tell you about the display, it's mesmerizing is all I could say. The Gorilla Glass 3 makes the screen all the more protective from scratches and also buttery smooth. It comes in 6GB and 8GB RAM models and either one of them would perform proactively and at it's best.The 6000 mAh battery is to look out for most in this smartphone. In simpler words. It just never quits! You just have to charge your phone once till 80-85% (in my case) and you're good to go for another whole day and still be left with enough juice to go on about the rest of the day without charging it halfway.The 25 watt super fast charging proves to be a champ in charging the phone at a blazing fast speed, leaving you worriless about the time consuming practice.The phone is a sleek looking one albiet it's also just a little bit heavy because of the insane 6000 mAh battery it consists of. Overall it looks amazing in your hand and it had that head-turning-vibe.Sony IMX68 sensor in the cameras prove to be a supreme highlight of the phone, it can take crystal clear pictures effortlessly. The night mode, the food mode, the slow-mo, the 4K mode, and even the normal 720 & 1080p modes are wonderfully constructed by the software. Like I said, this is a finely crafted smartphone. On top of that the side mounted finger print sensor does it's job simply and efficiently (which also means blazingly fast) for you to nothing but simply 'tap' and bam, you have your phone unlocked.Surprisingly, this phone, though being a mid-ranger model, is protected by Samsung's top notch security software 'Samsung Knox' which, if speaking in simple terms, if you have this phone, you can go about doing stuff on it like you usually do and leave the hard work to Samsung for protecting your device against brand new as well as age old malwares and viruses.

  I bought this phone with some confusions as it's having Exynos 9611 processor and Glasstic back, but after buying it I'm fully satisfied. I know chinese companies are giving Snapdragon within this price range but Exynos is a good processor for non gamers and day to day usage. It performs smoothly and honestly I haven't seen any lags. And the most important thing is you are geeting the brand value of Samsung.Pros-1. Great Display- Super Amoled display with drop notch makes the viewing experience great ??2. Big Battery- I'm a heavy user but still I get 1.5 day's battery backup. It comes with 25 watt fast charging which charges it's 6000 mah battery within 2 hrs.3. Brilliant Camera- There is no doubt one would get the bestest camera in this price range. The main 64 MP camera with Sony IMX makes it the best. Samsung's intellicam works great even the night mode and macro camera works fine. And the 32 MP front camera is superb.4. Weight Distribution- The weight of this phone is almost 203 gm. as it's having 6000 mah battery but Samsung managed the weight very good, and it doesn't feel heavy in hand.5. 3.5 mm headphone jack6. Good audio output with dolby atmosCons-1. Glasstic back- if you don't use cover there is a high chance of scratches.2. No TPU case- Samsung should have provided a tpu case within the box but they didn't so you have to buy it separately.3. Gorilla glass 3- It's time to give gorilla glass protection 5 as consumers are paying 19k-20k.Overall one can definitely go for this phone as it's non Chinese and a great deal within this price range. I'm very happy with this phone.

  The phone is actually nice. But nothing is perfect after all.1. The camera quality is amazing. But the screen starts to flicker when we try to use the slow motion video feature.2. Battery life is fine. If you keep the mobile data switched on all day till you sleep, the battery drains which should not happen easily as it is said be of 6000mah.3. The main problem is that the vibration feature doesn't turn off. It doesn't have any option to turn off vibration for messages.4. Operating system is good. Not faced any problem till now.5. The samsung keyboard should be upgraded a bit. It is easy to type on Google keyboard but not on this keyboard.So in my opinion, this cannot be a ""MUST"" buy but surely a good buy.

  Hi don't buy mobile in amazon send defective mobiles 2 times same problem

  CONS1. Battery life not worth the hype. Drains very quickly. Paying 20k for 6000 mah battery and watching the battery percentage go down in front of your eyes so quickly feels very bad. Am normal user, use only and only WhatsApp for office work and calling yet battery drains faster than my 3 year-old Lenovo K8 Plus.2. Unboxing experience not good either. Very disappointing that back cover was not included in box.3. Dated processor shows its mark occasionally for example when searching for something in the native Settings app or launcher.4. Camera performance in absence of abundant light is deplorableNOTE: Am facing weird call drop issue in WhatsApp calls but not sure if it's phone's faultPROS1. Fingerprint and face unlock are both very fast2. Single Take feature is amazing3. Screen, form factor, design looks and feels greatTL;DROverall, if you don't expect TOO much from the battery, you're gonna love this phone. Best non-Chinese phone under 20k atm

  If you are reading this review it means you are interested to buy This New Beast from the house of Samsung. Trust me it's a beast. Firstly let me clear something, I am not a gamer and mostly played light weight games just to fill up vacant time. Now coming straight to the point. Before having this device I was using Samsung A50 which was also a pretty good device, and just before that I used to have one plus 6 which is also a good device comparing the other brand available in market but during that time I never felt that Samsung can improve such way, and the result is M31S. It's a champ if I talk about battery life, touch sensitivity, fingerprint scanner sensitivity, screen quality ( It's super amoled), sound quality, network reception, no call drop issue, crystal clear sound from earpiece as well as from loud speaker which has pretty decent loud but soothing sound considering the price. Now come to the main highlighted point by Samsung which Camera, I am very much impressed though I don't use this feature very frequently but it can capture sharp and clear images. But as you know no one is perfect in this world so this device has also some drawbacks but can be overlooked easily if you want to have a good smart phone where your personal data is at lower risk. Cons: Camera makes images little over saturated, Some applications need time to get open and close (It seems they got hanged but soon they will be operational) which can be fixed through a software update. And it has Knox security. Thanks for your valuable time. Keep supporting Samsung and allow them to do good work.

  I am buying any Samsung phone after a long time. I actually love phones with stock Android and Samsung's UI is near to stock, no boatyard, no apps with privacy issue and an Amazing Super Amoled screen. Video viewing experience in this phone is great. Love its cameras and big 6000 man battery gives you juice for 1.5 days at least.I got it in discount so not feel I am buying a budget phone and I got eve for the price I paid.Just have a request from Samsung to give Led notification feature as A series have.

  The back body has a opening, can see the battery and other peripherals through and through.Suggest to buyers - Please check properly when you get your piece.Not happy with samsung.

  Screen - 10/10, mindblowing.Looks - 10/10, feels premium.Battery - 11/10, absolute beast.Touch - 10/10, fluid and super responsive.Camera - 8/10, not too great but performs well in low light and has good features.Performance - 8/10, though it has a somewhat weak processor, it doesn’t lag rather performs really well even when simultaneously running different apps.Security - 8/10, it is secured by knox on a hardware level only, so doesn’t have a secure folder like the high end models and A series. But it is way more secure than other android phones from different brands.Value for money - 9/10.Overall - 9/10, if you are not into gaming and would like a phone which does absolutely well in other aspects, then this is the phone for you.

  The screen went black on 16th September, i.e. after about one month's use. Samsung Service Centre initially said that there is some software issue. Later on they said that the mother board needs to be replaced and they don't know how long it would take. The matter was taken up with Samsung and nothing has been done so far. After six days, the repair status on their website says that the service order is cancelled because warranty papers have not been received by them, which is absolutely rubbish because their Service Centre accepted the phone only after verifying the warranty details. Absolutely third rate service and phone by Samsung.

  Bought it on very first day of the sale 6th Aug, got it on 8th or 9th ....delivery was good.Then after 4 days of use the phone got BLACKED OUT.Checked with Samsung service centre, the display was dead, they said you need to replace the phone from Amazon.Callled Amazon, booked a technician on 13th August, got an appointment of 16th... Technician did not visit instead said you come to my place to get ur mobile checked. When I refused he cancelled the visit stating customer not available.Called Amazon again booked another appointment with technician after two days i.e for 18th Aug. Phone was checked technician approved the replacement.Called Amazon for replacement, they refused as the product was not available, i waited for more 2-3 days still it was not available.Then I requested for refund, they were ready to give, refund request was processed. Date - 23rd Aug.Pick up was scheduled the very next day, delivery guy came to pick up the phone . He refused the pickup as the phone was in dead condition.( Amazon service team did not inform them the phone was dead) understandable.Scheduled another pickup my calling Amazon stating the same problem. But no was has visited to pickup the phone.It's 26th Aug today. Only God knows now when the damn phone will be picked and I will get the refund.#DisappointedAmazon.Totally disappointed with Amazon team.

  I selected this phone because I don't buy Chinese phone and support made in India. But at this price Samsung disappoint me because camera in slow motion not working at night lights.

  for better camera buy only nokia 7.2 and install gcam. M31s camera also good , details and exposure is great in daylight shots but in low light m31s fails against nokia 7.2 with gcam(My friend have nokia 7.2). Front camera in night gives poor details in images.Overall  design is awesome . I purchased m31s because of its dispaly and design. Battery is good also.But i recommend to buy simply samsung m21 if punch hole display and macro camera doesn't  matter for you. M21 has also good camera. My brother  purchased m21 seven days ago and i see the difference in pictures, Minor differences in camera between  m21 vs m31s.

  This is the BEST BUDGET PHONE samsung has ever made. i wanted to add a photo of the phone but after using the phone, I don't feel like taking pictures with other phones.To start with, when I did the unboxing, I felt like I was holding a premium device the minute I took it out of the box. To be honest, It feels more premium than ?80k phone. Here's my take on the phone....Biggest Improvements -1. The camera (64MP) is flawless and capture details with amazing contrast. Intellicam feature is just AWESOME.2. The side mounted fingerprint sensor. It is the faster than many flagship phones I have ever used.3. The Punch-Hole camera (infinity-o) Display. It is just BEAUTIFUL.4. 4k video support. Just love it.5. The battery (6,000 mAh) get me going for 2 days without charging.6. 25 watt (type c to type c) charger is included in the box and fully charges my phone (0-100) in 1h15m. Perfect !!7. The AMOLED screen is the biggest highlight. Plus Samsung makes the perfect displays.8. Expandable Storage upto 1 TB plus dual sim slots. Highly user friendly.9. Selfie camera (32mp) is very very very sharp.10. Other amazing features like, latest software, scheduled dark mode, scheduled blue light filter, etc make it the best buy ever.Biggest Downside-NONEMy SuggestionSTOP THINKING AND BUY IT RIGHT AWAY. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT AT ALL.Hope this helps.

  This is my review after 1st impression of Smasung M31. The phone looks cool a bit bulky but that's okay it has a humungous 6000mah battery. Screen is outstanding. Battery is marvelous. CAMERA is also good with tons of features. Haven't played pubg yet but hopefully it will perform good. The phone is designed and produced in India. Security is no concern with Samsung.And and fingerprint sensor is lightning fast.UPDATE: PubG runs great at smooth and extreme.

  Got the phone today but I m not happy with its performance. I don't know why the ph is getting us excessively hot even on attending calls. My cheeks r burning. Battery is not that good as expected.  It drains quite fast for no reason. While typing this comment I have seen fall in 2% of Battery level. This is not expected from Samsung ( remembering this have a 6000 mAh battery ) thinking of replacement. Will use it for 2 more days till den. Let's see how it goes.

  This is best smartphone  comes  under 20k segment.What's  best:1. Camera: Samsung  m31s has best camera as compared  to other Chinese phones  in this price  range, it gives clear, and correctly  contrasted  detailed pics. I can use this  for my small video recording projects.  Video recording stabilization  works  on AI which  won't  give stable  videos  recording when you are running,  but this will work fine with normal recording.  I give 4 out of 5 stars  to camera.2. UI: Yes, the one ui is awesome  and feels  smooth. Samsung  icons  look more  vibrant  and you can hide your apps too.Like in Chinese  smartphone  where  you use 3 fingers  gesture  to take screen shots, you can use palm gestures  to fake screen shots.3. Samsung  keyboard: You read  right, the Samsung  keyboard  is really  optimized  for m31s. I really  like  the  feature where  a lens appears  just above  the text you  select,  this makes typing  more comfortable. Also, the word suggestion is really  smart.Display: Super amoled  display which is really  appealing and vibrant, I didn't  see a Chinese  smartphone  giving  this in same price range or even in IPhone.  Adaptive  brightness  is smart, you won't  even  have to touch your brightness  control  when this feature  is on. The details  look clear and readable  easily  in direct  sunlight.  I like  the  always on display features. There  are lots more display  features which  you cannot ignore.Battery, Ram management,  display  frequency  management, build  quality, I can keep writing its pros, because the smartphone  deserves  this.Cons:1.  I felt  this little  bit overpriced2. Battery  and charger  could  be improved provided  with  m31s3. Screen  protector  and back cover should  have been  provided.4.  Video  stabilization could  be improved5. Samsung  could  use SS processor, but  they have used their own exynos processor. Anyway, ala it's  giving  good responses so I don't  care much about  processor.Final words:I really like  the m31s smartphone. This gives premium  feeling  with great quality. This is giving  tough competition  to many Chinese  brands. If you are confused and lost  what to buy, buy this and ?.Don't  forget  to order screen  protector  and back cover too, because  You might  not find it in the local  market.

  Please don't go by marketing of this product. The same configuration is available with other brands by 15 K to 17 K.This phone could have the best by 17 Max, not more than that.Its the same experience as other Samsung phone in this range.I must tell you Samsung has meet Peoples expectation by matching all feature as Redmi... including look if you put some cover on the phone.Camera is Good...Rest your choice how u r analyzing the features , price and comparison with other brands.

  Monster PerformanceAfter 3 weeks of usage, I must say, I am fully satisfied with the Samsung Galaxy M31s 8GB Mirage Blue Smartphone.Great battery life,Great Speed,Fits in your palm grip (others complain about its less breadth, but I am more than happy),No nonsense pre-installed apps,Little expensive,3.5 mm jack for audio,Type C charger,High-speed Charging,Its 'Single-take' option is amazing taking Video and Photo at the same time,Only need to put a snapdragon processor instead.

  This mobile doesn't justify its cost.Cons- No led indicator  provided to show the notification .Battery life is not up to the markCamera is OKWhen I received this package it was just wrapped in plastic packet . No bubble Wrap was provided.Lot of dust on mobile when I open the box  . Thin plastic cover was not even wrapped as new .I have bought this on EMI and canceling might cause me fine from bank so I have to keep it as there is no Replacement only return is applicable.Even samsung box was having scratches .

M31s with exynos can't handle 90 hz refresh rate6. Gaming experience not so great7. Misses out on high screen refresh rateExynos 9611 SoC that has been making the rounds on several A series and M series phones over the past year. Rival phones from the likes of Xiaomi, POCO and Realme use Snapdragon 720G / 730G or MediaTek G90T chipsets, which are more performance-oriented. If benchmarks are looked at, the M31s’ scores do fall behind.

  Samsung Galaxy M31s, I ordered this phone in Amazon's first sale on 7th August. And this phone was delivered to me on the 13th of August.  So I am reviewing this phone today on September 9, after using it for 27 days.Design : This phone is very good in terms of look and design.Display : The screen is very good, no problem watching videos and browsing the internet.Camera: The camera of this phone is also very good. Captures high resolution in 64 megapixel.Front Camera: The front camera does not take clear pictures, it makes it slightly fed up.Touch Response : Touch response is also very good, no problem. No lag problems were seen yet.RAM Management : RAM remains in memory for a long time. RAM management is very well optimized.Sound : Speaker volume is very loud but not like stereo speaker.Internet Speed : Any website opens in seconds. Internet speed is also great.Battery : I noticed a battery drain issue in this phone. I don't know if the other user's phone has a battery problem or not, but the automatic battery in my phone keeps getting low. And while using the phone, 1% of the battery runs out in 3-5 minutes. Sometimes 7 to 9% of the battery in the phone ends up on its own in a few hours. It seems that a 6000 mAh battery is equivalent to 4000 mAh.Heating : This phone also has a heating issue, sometimes when charging the phone, the temperature reaches 48 degrees and 42 to 43 degrees in normal use. And in WhatsApp calling, the phone gets very hot and the call is cut automatically.PROS :Good Camera QualityBetter PerformanceFast ChargingAwesome Display QualityCons :Battery Drain issueHeating issueI hope Samsung resolves these issues in the next update.

  M31s was delivered on 31st August.  Love the phone.Macro snapshot feature of M31s clearly shows the veins of a leaf.The photo of the phone has not been taken from a M31s.Pros:1 The power button  is  also a fingerprint reader and recognizes quickly. Similar results with face recognition.2. Almost Bezel free display3. Macro camera is impressive4. Phone is good for average gaming and doesn't drain the battery quickly5. Phone charging is pretty quickCons1. Sound quality could've been better but I'm still giving it a 5 star2. The phone doesn't come with an ear phone or back cover

  Great Phone for the price.. I know you can get a better Mi or Other Chinese company phone for this price.. But the thing is I've used them...You can customize their android and comes with m9re features for sure .. But.. You can't.. never ever compete with the hardware quality of Samsung in any way.. i mean.. you'll definitely start feeling cheapness after using those phones for a while... while Samsung phones maintains their perfectness, thanks to superior build quality and technology! And That's my review!

  Hello Everyone, I was waiting for such great phone from first look of M31s release, Everything is great, Camera is giving great experience at this price range, battery is completely monstorous, what a great capacity, look is very stylish, Ram 6 gb and Internal 128gb provides great support. Fingerprint also in different position gives new experience. Samsung always gives first preference to security, In M31s security is also best. I request you all to select Samsung and boycott Chinese brands.  From last 9 years I am using Samsung mobiles every time Samsung gives better as expected. Thats Why I love & trust Samsung. I am also thankful to Amazon for providing best services and great partnership with Samsung. #ThankYouAmazon #ThankYouSamsung

  This smartphone is  awesome!! I have had it for about 18 days and it is great!!Here's  a detailed review:Build Quality- Although  the material  is glastic , the whole gradient look is quite awesome and almost seems to be metal . A little tip though, invest in a good clear back - cover if you don't want to  get your fingerprints  all over it.Camera - The 64 MP rear camera is great !! It captures every single detail beautifully.The ultra-wide lens is far better than several others in the same price range and has near to none curvature of field .Macro-camera is simply phenomenal!! You can 'see' the 5MP in all the details. It could even capture the pollen grains on the inside of a flower!!The night mode is works like magic !! It transforms photos at dusk to photos of a jovial afternoon. And the Single take ! It's  perfect for capturing one - time occasions like Birthdays.Display- It's Samsung people!! You know the display is going to be the best !! The punch hole camera really does make quite the difference from M31.Fingerprint Sensor- Instantaneous!! And the position is optimum. After a while, it almost becomes instinct.Battery- Monster!! Absolute monster !! It can power through 2 days of mild usage and 25 W fast charging..I don't  even have to plug it in for a hour to get it from 20% - 100 %!!Software and Performance - Neat. It's seamless. The One Ui 2.1 feels great. I have to say .. In the set-up it does try to install a great deal of apps but still other than that, I see no problem.  Some of Samsung's Own apps are great..I have run several games at once on this thing but still , not a lag.Verdict- Go for it !! If your looking for a phone under 20k , this is the best  you'll  find . The display, the battery, the camera everything feels perfect .

  The camera quality simply superb and battery backup is better. The performance was comparably better with other models. My suggestion is good to buy.All aspects of the phone are on par or above the next segment.The display is gorgeous.Lookwise, it doesn't feel like an M series phone.FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.However, it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (Got reverse charging as well).The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use the A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side-mounted fp scanner.

  Amazing phone with outstanding battery .  Really a monster phone as advertised by Samsung . I have been a iPhone user and just thought of trying something not very expensive from Samsung stable and bought this phone on Amazon and this has not disappointed me even a little bit .Using Samsung M31S for last 3 weeks and can vouch that its quite a decent phone for those who want a large display , long lasting battery , lot of internal storage , super fast & reverse charging .Just a small manufacturing defect - small rubber protruding from back cover but that was not related to performance so can say overall a very good phone at a decent price .

  Nothing great in this mobile,lot of social media hype, I purchased this to avoid china mobiles, but a 100% disappointment from samsung I will never go for samsung mobile again in my life time , frankly it is like a China mobile with build quality ,plastic body, camera  Nokia 2mp is better than this ,worst camera experience, 30s is bad in camera what my wife is using, 31s is more worst camera than 30s, waste of money it is like 7k budget mobile, my earlier redmi 3s prime is 100%better,I ordered redmi note 7 pro for my father before lockdown for 8.5k, which is very nice in camera point of view. I strongly recommend don't go,weight of mobile also more

  1. I have disappointed with front camera, it is 32 mega pixels but the quality of photo's is not really good,  when you zoom the pic it's not looking clearly.2. Samsung is not providing ear phones, screen guard or cover case.3. Charger is having C3 connection, so charger cable is having C3 pin for both the sides. so you can use cable for reverse charging with other devices but we can't use same cable to connect with USB or power bank.4. Even it is 6GB RAM the mobile is not so quick to respond.5. 6000mah battery for new mobile  it is coming 1 day if we use data continuously.6. But good thing is single take photo option.

  Everything about the phone is just perfect.Camera is great, even in low light it captures light well. Even My OnePlus 6 does not capture that amount of light in night mode.Battery life is really good. Only thing is it takes time to get it 100% charged, but that's again because of 6k battery size.Looks are just awesome, the screen is dynamic and feels premium. Colors are vibrant as well.Sound quality is good, it does have Atmos. I still have to explore that option, but I hope it delivers good sound.The side finger scanner responds slightly slower if you have used some other high end mobiles. But I think it's is not something which will slow down the performance.Watching 4k videos is just amazing. You will love it.Overall I would say, it's much premium feel and does the job well. I am using OnePlus 6 as well, but really happy with this M31S phoneJust go for it

  Its been around 2 weeks I am using this phone. Lets talk about the drawbacks first--It can store only 3 fingerprints.-If you leave the app open and open the phone after sometime, the app doesn't respond. I find it quite irritating. I thought its in my phone only so I ordered a replacement from Amazon, they did it without any issue. but new phone has same issue.-Weight is much more to hold it for long in hands. :(Things I like- - Monster shot - Amazing- Screen resolution and quality display is commendable.- In this price, there is everything that others 'good brands' are delivering almost at double.Lets see how it goes.... :)

  I got this phone less than one month ago. It does not have any protection from water.the phone was accidentally dropped in less than half feet of shallow water and was removed within seconds.But the display stopped working.The samsung service centre in hyderabad checked it and said that a charge chip which connects display is gone.But the irony is that part is not available at samsung service centres in Hyderabad. I am calling up all the samsung service centres in hyderabad but couldn't get the spare part. Waiting for the service centres to get the parts in a week or so.  This clearly shows how delicate the phone is and most importantly samsung has not made available the required spare parts to its service centres. Keeping my fingers crossed and hoping for an early miracle.

  Device is just too good to view content in very aspect. A 6000mah battery haven't impressed a lot becoz of obsessed ONE UI running in the background, but it took me for a walk all over the day. No complaints on ram management and app response times with no lag. Though a glastic back, which can be covered by a premium back case, the screen seems to be flawless and perfect. I had some network issues with the device in my area. Network grasping of the device near villages where we usually feel very low network ranges is very poor. I tested this with my other two mobiles and came to know that data speeds are very low on m31s. But in towns and cities and places near to celltowers the network speeds are amazing.Camera is most attractive featute of the device. Thanks to its fantastic dynamic range.Overall, the device is a perfect all rounder at the price point with many pros and little cons. Not to say perfect, but stands out on its mark.Maynot be a value for money product but you can go for it blindly if you are day to day user.SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT.

  While i was searching for a non-chinese phone - Samsung came to my rescue, it was about to release M31s, a replica of M31 - with very few minor enhancements. Was eagerly waiting for it and at last ordered on the launch date.Ordered at midnight!! A class delivery - reached quickly on 10 Aug.The expectation was almost met with the phone - with the satisfaction of not using a Chinese phone.I am not a gamer, so did not notice a drop in performance so far.Display is crystal clear and camera is good. Yet to experience in depth camera features.Finger print scanner is descent enough and face recognition is also good - though disabled it.The battery life is good and stands for 1.5 days with complete basic usage - WA/Mails/Calls.I have to come back after a better usage in a month or two.I agree on the decision to stop earphones, as we have our own desires on the model - but I would recommend Samsung to add a basic silicon back case going forward in the box - so that we can use it from day-1 with ease. This phone was quite slippery, so had to handle with extra caution. I ordered the case, on the same launch day.Overall good, but the price could have been much more competitive - as almost the same price as M31.On a side note - i also saw some bad experience with few Users where the phone did not start-up and went dead in 2 days. I think those are very rare conditions and could happen with any electronic gadgets. Samsung/Amazon should definitely get back to these clients and serve them as quick as possible, to maintain the customer service.

  Samsung M31s - Good camera quality with high-resolution pictures. Perfect battery backup. I use this phone the whole day after a full charge and the phone has a good battery backup. I like the phone and pictures clicked from this phone is far better than the other phone in the same price range. I love the Samsung m31s quality and processor. Almost perfect in the given price range. Value for money.The sound quality is also good in videos, youtube, songs, and also in video recording.

  I received the phone which had it's screen damaged on the edge. And I have to return it. Not sure how they claim it to be gorilla glass..Camera is good.But disappointed that it's no more available in stock.

  Battery life and camera quality is good but the Samsung chipset is still the old one and this can pass you off sometimes. Your phone will start handing as soon as you do multitasking . This happens even when you are not playing any games or even not using any heavy application.Also the camera quality is good but it is definitely not 64mega pixel.I am writing this review after 10 days of using this phone.

  The product is undoubtedly a market mover I. Its range, keeping in mind the fact that this is a Non-Chinese, trustworthy brand that is made as well as assembled in India. Now talking about the phone, the UI is amazing. Previously, I owned a Samsung J series smartphone and then switching to this is such a lovely experience for me.I have done a full charge test, and believe me the fast charging is an icing on the cake which unexpectedly comes with this handset. My phone took a total, to charge its monster 6000 mAh battery, 107 minutes from 0-100%. The optimisation truly works. The battery backup is good, sound and video qualities are Uber awesome. Camera is well designed. Screen looks premium that you may find in samsung flagship models. All in all, I'll give you a big thumbs up if you have made up your mind to buy this phone.The only problem with me is the processor, it could have been better than this when we are paying more than 20k for this. Never mind, I am more than happy with the chipset and processor because I am not a very heavy user. I hardly play any high-graphic games on this. For me, it works good.If you want a phone that meets all your expectations in a range of 20k, blindly go for this. I have the 8 gb 128 gb variant, and I got a flat discount of INR 1500/- through my HDFC credit card on the prime day sale on 5th of this month. If the offer is still there, go and avail it if you've a HDFC credit card with you.

  Review after 20 days usage:Highlights:1. A WOW display ! - A vivid display with stunning colours and sharpness, which makes an amazing viewing experience. Videos and photos are a pleasure to watch.2. Battery - 6000 mAh monster battery - easily lasts for more than 30 hours with average usage3. Design - A more premium looking smatphone at this price segment4. Camera - 64 MP quad camera surely lives upto its expectations. A plethora of options to exploreWhat could have been better:1. Fingerprint sensor - the side mounted finger print sensor could be annoying at times. Not so fast2. Taking screenshot is not so easy - a simple button in the top navigation panel could have been awesome.The overall performance in my last 20 days of moderate usage has been excellent. The touchscreen works smoothly. So far, I dint encounter hanging while using any of the apps. A very satisfying and pleasant experience so far with the mobile.

  This phone makes me saying this, you can't judge Samsung by just its specs. Using this phone from last 5 days, and believe me, it worth every single penny, I spent, At least for me.Upgraded from OnePlus 3T, and reason behind loving this phone is, it's epic display and buttery one UI. And, this are the only thing I care for, because I am not a gamer, so 9611 is more than required for me. As far as there is no lags in UI, it's fine for me, and there is no lags at all.In hand feel is also good, while holding this no one can agree that it is having 6000mah battery, Thumb up for this. I was able to pull out ~9 hr of screen on time. And speakers are also enough loud and clear.If you are not a HARD-CORE gamer then go for it. (Reason behind highlighting hard-core, many people play 2-3 rounds of pubg and refer themselves hard-core gamer, No you are not. And who plays games like COC, you don't even need to think)Let me tell you again, It's UI and Display is insanely great. After this, I really really think, OnePlus's Oxygen Os is totally over-rated.One more thing, Samsung do not provide case and screen protector out of the box, this is not a big thing, still annoying.

  Facing issue into network connectivity. I've 2 Airtel number and on calling to the number using in samsung galaxy m31s most of the time I've says the number you have dialed is out of network coverage area while on second or third try the call is successfuly connected and again after some time same thing repeating again. On other number using in different device has no issue.Trying to test one or two more days if the issue persist then I'll try to replace it

  Must Buy in the mid range . Best Display , Best Camera , Smooth Performance.1. PERFORMANCEThe performance of this phone is perfect. BUT NOT FOR HEAVY GAMERS . Normally 1-2 hours of PUBG is OK but not for several hours. Its processor is bit Older but its optimization is so much good . You will not face any single issue regarding its performance.Fingerprint Sensor is working smoothly. But face unlocking takes few seconds as i think it is for security purpose only. You can change the face recognition settings to fast mode.2. CAMERAIts Camera is the main highlight in this phone.it shots pretty impressive pictures . If you are selfie lover then GO for it. It wont disappoint you. In low light also it takes quite good pictures.3.BATTERYUhh!! It has a huge monster battery of 6000mAh. You can understand the backup of this phone. I cant say anything about its battery. Don't bother about its battery backup.4.DISPLAYThe samsung AMOLED displays are in TOP in the market. Awesome display I can say...........................................................................................................................................................................................And Yeah Samsung gives variety of features in this phone. You will find interesting about it.Till now i haven't got any issue regarding this phone.NOTE  :  NOT FOR HEAVY GAMING.Overall a Best Phone .I hope this finds you HelpfulThank You..

  Hey Guys, I Bought this phone in Amazon's Prime day sale. It was delivered within 3 days. Appreciating Amazon's Delivery Service.If you want to see the full Unboxing of this Phone, then you may visit our YouTube -> @shuttertechlearningSo here are my pros and cons for the phone:PROS:-> 6000mAh battery is mind blowing, it is giving a battery backup of average 2 days on normal use> Amoled screen is mind blowing, with a on-screen front camera> It is thin and light weight, looks similar like Samsung Note 10> Side Power button with in-built fingerprint sensor is too fastCONS:-> Although not a major cons but camera lacks in low light macro photography.> Back gradient looks awesome but you need to take a good care of it. As it gets easily scratches.Thank You !Stay Home-Stay Safe

  A perfect phone at 20k rangeThe screen is gorgeous, no doubtIt looks great, the metallic back looks almost premiumCamera module is to the point. Quality of photos it churns out is unbelievable, comparable to oneplus in my opinionBattery life is definitely not a problemA few pointers so you make the best lf the phoneThe processor is good but a bit aged. For best performance, switch to a static wallpaper and Remove the unnecessary apps that can be removed and disable the rest. I use the nova launcher as it's faster than Samsung's home screen.All in all, it's a phone that's amazing to use and really I'm impressed with the camera

  See.. I'm being a tech enthusiast, writing this review!!! I've used this phone for almost 2 weeks!! See first of all I'll tell u that if u r a gamer don't prefer this phone..if u are a normal user u can choose it!!I'm being a student I faced no problems or any bugs using this phone!! The One UI which is the latest one is very user friendly and gives u a Very premium experience while using this phone..See, in a phone the hardware is important but the software should be optimised too otherwise there's no use of being a high level hardware..see it's battery is the best.. display is very amazing..6.5"" sAmoled display is a decent size but it's colors and saturation is very Greattttt guys!! Trust me, if u want a non Chinese phone under 20k it's the best thing u can get for a normal user like me!! I use the phone from 9am to 11pm continuosly nearly I keep my phone for 2 or 3hrs aside,It gives me a full day battery experience..I charge 1time in morning bas! So battery is the best!! Thumb's up ???? Now coming to camera it comes with sony imx 682 sensor which clicks very accurate photos in day and night too!! See for this price the night shots are also good not that bad!! If u will use night mode for low light shots it can click the best...but if there's very less light then better use flash?? So conclusion is u can buy this phone and it justifies it's price so u can go for it!!????

   1. It is smooth in grip meanwhile but due to plastic mix body changes of slip reduces.2. Lock button with fingerprint scanner is really a great concept.Double press function, notification tray slide are some features.3. You can have Alarms/Playback/Events/Weather on Lock screen.4. Almost every function is available on notification tray.5. Super Amloed Screen gives you a glance experience.6. Customize your phone according to you.

  O stars for this product most filthy cheap product with very high sar values the sar value is even much much higher than even xiaomi phones it started hanging from the very first touch of the phone m31s is the most filthy waste hopeless product ever made by Samsung the phone becomes too hot like an hot iron when u attend a call even for 2 minutes totally waste that is why i was forced to return this product on the 3rd day of purchase battery drain is also too high in m31sI also own a m30s which I had purchased 11 months back it is working fine till date compared to m31sMy sincere request to all people reading my review is that don't purchase m31s and waste ur hard earned money please please

  I gave ip one plus to buy this. I am totally satisfied on the performance. I have used apple phone  too but thus one is the best. 8 GB Ram makes its performance superfast in the digital highway. And with clear photographs and videos, I am not disappointed. Excellent camera for selphies, too. Battery life is great as i recharge only once despite a heavy rush of Company emails  global teleconferences and other stuff. Fingerprint reader is better than the best.

  The overall product is good but the camera is pathetic. Being the 64 MP it has very poor image resolution. The picture quality gets deteriorated on just zooming it. The front camera being 32 MP is giving by default 5 MP image and with two person in it gives 8 MP, but has the same image deterioration on zooming it. What is purpose being 32 MP on when your getting 5 & 8 MP picture.  The Samsung needs to seriously look on such issue of camera image quality. As they push this model based on the 64 MP sony camera with better resolution which was lacking immensely. Even the Amazon technician did not resolved the issue and has to finally return the product.

  Over all this phone is amazing basically my brother bought this for him but i exchanged it with his old samsung note 8...and i instantly became a huge fan of it...Good things about the phone is you cannot empty the battery even after long hours of gaming(PUBG*before ban*, COD, Modern warfare.etc.) also the finger print reader is way too snappy. I'm a bit of a techie guy and choose phones after reading lot of reviews. This phone is worth all the money you've spent. Plus it looks cool, back cover is necessary its delicate backa nd camera bump. Rest phone is perfect and camera is quite good at this price with some major feature and some useless feature which i dont use at all.I recommend this phone for daily as well as gaming purpose, it serves you well with more then 6 hrs battery remaining once you decide to go sleep after a day usage. Thats crazy.

  Impressive camera setup. Have attached samples of 123° ultrawide, macro, food photo & 64 mp along with the pics of the phone front and rear. The battery life is astonishing.. I cud get almost 3 days juice out of a single charge.. I am not an extensive user and I use Bluetooth for my calls. The display is just fab and the UI is ultra smooth unlike the BADA which used to be on older phones. This is the best phone one can pick in the price segment.

  Fingerprint sensor:-Fingerprint sensor is good but not so fast. And once in everyday to unlock the mobile, it asks the security password.Battery life:-Battery life is awesome.I saw one or two movies daily.And I use camera for video recording for youtube channel. Sometimes for 2 hours continuously but the battery percentage drop is just 20 to 30%.And I play games in Mx player daily.And I use phone for normal use like calls, internet browsing, reading books, and watching youtube videos.But I used to I charge only once a day even.And for charging it takes nearly 2 hours.Camera quality:-And comes to camera quality I upload some images taken by samsung m31s. You can see it. And for video recording for youtube videos i use open camera app because in camera app given by samsung i didn't find exposure lock. So thats why I use open camera app.And if you want to see the video quality, check this link https://youtu.be/W0encosL-gUAnd while video recording morethan 1.5 to 2 hours. Phone gets heat lightly at the backside. But after stop video recording within few minutes the heat lasts away.Overall performance:-And coming to overall performance, this mobile is good. Good sound, good battery life, good display.Problems that I face:-1. While reading pdf or using samsung notes app and some other apps, I leave the mobile aside, its locked. After when i unlock the mobile, the app didn't interact for my touches like swiping, or tap to write something. At that time when go to recent apps menu and again click on app from the recent app menu. Again the app works.2. Just today, I have a notification from google play about tez shot game. And while I playing that game I face some frame drops but I don't know thats the mobile problem or app problem.3. And comes to sound quality. It was good but almost sound comes in between the volume levels of 4 to 10. When I place at level 4. The sound was too low and cant able to hear. And while changing volume level at one level the sound drops much.Finally I am totally satisfied with this mobile and I love this mobile. Because it satisfying all my needs like good camera, big battery, amoled display, side mounted fingerprint sensor, fast charging, good speaker.Thank you

  Using  Samsung M31s-6gb 128 gb Mirage  Blue from. Last 15 days, There are 5 things which are pretty Osama:1. Battery life is very good even with heavy Mobile use it goes upto 2 days and take only 1.45 hr to fully charged.2. Mirage Blue color looks great3. Display is Osama s-amoled infinite no comparison with other phones in this range4. Selfi camera is great even you can use it from some distance by just showing your palm towards the camera it captures Selfi so no click needed5.  Quard camera gives a boost with great features like single shot mode for those who are good in clicking pictures and for those who are not good at clicking pictures like me6. I did not find any slowness even when I m playing any games but I am not a hard-core gamer so won't play games like public I am outdoor games lover.Overall a great experience with Samsung M31s. The best part is its a non Chinese product and have better features.

  Worst phone ever from day 2 it's been malfunctioning Amazon has the worst return policy they will send the technician and the problem solution he will provide is just factory reset and problem will be solved but the problem will occur again and then the 7 days period is gone and you can not do anything but to go to the samsung service center and stull your problem won't solve there they will update the phone and tell you the problem is solved sir and if will never occur again and then after one day you will face the same problem. This is how the samsung m31s works for me. Highly disappointed in samsung but highly appreciated the Amazon help mr. Ajmal and Vaishali ji they helped  me getting a replacement after 27 days they restore my faith in Amazon and stated that Amazon will not decieve their customer.

  I posted this review after 2 days usages. Actually, I order this phone for my friend. According to him phone is so smooth and also the screen quality is amazing. Yaahh!!! You cannot get this type of amoled screen from any other brand in this prize segment only samsung providing it!! Both Cameras are very good and screen with infinity-O display looks bigger and brighter!!The battery is massive, the charging time with 25Watt charger (including in box) is around 90-100min but battery back you get with normal social media usages and YouTube usages is around 30-36hrs which is incredible!!Note:- this phone comes with Exynos 9611 octacore professor which is quite disappointing. This processor is 1½ years old. Their is no problem with this processor for normal usages but if you r heavy gamer and want to play PUBG, Asphalt like games in high or Ultra-High graphics then this phone might not for you!!So, at last my recommendation is that , if you r a normal user who not played game alot and only usage is social media and multimedia then must go for this phone!!Bcoz you cannot get this type feature from any other smartphone brand and major highlight is that this phone is made in India and samsung is not a Chinese brand also samsung Knox security is very good!! So must buy!!!But if you're heavy gamer then you can ignore this phone, final decision is yours!!??

  This phone is best non Chinese option under 20k with best battery and Camera performance. If I would rate it under 5 here are my ratings following after usage for 10 days.1. Battery performance - 5/5It would last for nearly 1.5-2 days for normal usage. Very well optimised under One UI 2.1, 6000mah2. Camera performance - 4/5Sony IMX 682 sensor in Samsung really does good job but after image processing it stays on the cooler side. Single shot option is good for fancy photography.3. Side fingerprint - 4.5/5Its faster than In display fingerprints of Samsung A series.4. Speaker performance - 4/5Its not stereo speaker but its very loud and good single speaker.6. Processor - 3/5Exynos 9611 is one generation old and its good for normal users but not as good as Snapdragon 720g or 730g for heavy usages and gaming. And Samsung should improve it as soon as possible because its of one generation back and Chinese company provide Snapdragons in this budget range.Samsung should also provide Corning Gorilla glass 5 and + as other Chinese phones comes with.Knox security is here in this phone but not its full version.And major missing is NFC support which Samsung doesn't provide in M series but it should as phones range is 20k which is higher.

  Software problem causes hang out . Screen disappears with flash, in the beginning it could be made ON when plugged for charging. Lastly the phone set found dead , it couldn't be made ON even after technical support from Samsung. Need to move Service center with such a new Branded Phone. Other features couldn't be observed as because the set not run successfully.Product is now at service center for its repair . First time I have been informed about display problem but couldn't be resolved. Further I came to know from service center about its mother board problem. Still awaiting for its repair. Coupon is not provided easily to purchase another Set. Several times contacted Customer Care with email, no one helped to provide Coupon as because the Set was found defective since beginning. So pl beware before purchasing..

  From my personal view, this is the best phone under 20000. Ya, like every phone this phone also have some pros and cons.Pros:1. Amazing display. I Just felt in love with this display.2. Amazing battery life. I am a heavy user and in one cycle of charge, my whole day is easily covered. And charging speed is also high. No heating issue during charging.3. Amazing camera quality. Both front and back are awesome.4. Awesome design. When u will take it in hand it's feels like premium phones. Back panel is plastic but trust me u will not feel it. It's feels like glass.And that Punch hole is like extra cashew in your milkshake.5. One UI is very smooth and easy to use. Dark mode and always on display are one ofmy favorite feature.6. U can control ur notification panel with ur fingerprint sensor. This is my favorite feature of one UI. It's very helpfull. No device will give u this feature.7. No heating issue.8. Knox security is there.Cons:1. Processor is exynos 9611, but if u r not a gamer, then this phone is best for u in this price range.2. Fingerprint positioning should be in display. It's not justifying with amaloed display.3. No secure folder.Conclusion: If u r not a heavy gamer, then this phone is best for you under 20000.

  The performance of the phone is poor. There's a lag in loading the apps and downloading the content on whatsapp. Amazon crashes very often. With a very minimal apps and usage I see it stuck for every few minutes on my 3rd day of this phone usage. There's a connectivity issue in this phone. It drops connection after receiving a call, for every few minutes and requires turning on and off the connections .

  Pros:+ The display is the standout feature here, just brilliant.+ Battery life is very good & fulfills its promise, lasting more than a day & a half.+ Nice sound too from a single speaker, it can get rather loud.Middling/undecided:= Camera seems good enough but I haven't tested it much beyond some nice indoor selfies in artificial light.= Responsive enough for daily use by a senior person, not intending to use this for heavy gaming at all.= The 128GB storage & Dedicated SD card support is good enough at the Rs.19.5k price range (as of September 2020) & should keep things comfortable without needing to continuously make space available for the long run.Cons:- Samsung's software, had to tinker around & change or remove some apps like Phone to Google defaults because the alternatives weren't as customizable or familiar. Tries to install a lot of bloat during setup. If you like Samsung's ecosystem features then this shouldn't stop you.- The fingerprint sensor isn't as sharp as it could have been & is hit & miss. Being on the edge gives it a learning curve as your finger needs to be positioned correctly to cover the sensor.

  The super samples display is best in class under 20000 category.DESIGN is glastic and gives very premium in hand feelBattery is awesome and 25 w c to c cable is best.its the same charger as s20 and also it's only the super fast charger in this segment.Camera is best in 20000 and got many flagship features  like single take etc.It has Knox only for securing phones and files but no secure folder .So the safest phone alsoThe processor is also nice.i played pubg in smooth extreme 60 fps and game was smooth .Only processor except for g90t to give 60 fps.its better than sd 730g in terms of speed as it has total clockspeed of 16.12 GHz while 730g has 15.4ghz.now it's your choice.both fingerprint and face unlock is very fast.

  All ok , but there is no headset in it nor screen guard nor a back cover. So it would be better to order it separately in amazonif you are buying a new mobile Samsung Galaxy m31s. I think this a not the fault of Amazon I think this  is a mistake done by Samsung. So I request samsung to please take a look on this because it is would be a better for Samsung brand to make a better profit and sales. And I am very greatful  for amazon because this is favouring a difficulties into opportunities for others, hats off for amazon for helping us in this pandemic and critical situations.

  It's a review after two weeks of usage. Battery life is damn good. Even after my hectic day when my old phone needed a charge this shows 50% remaining. Camera is super awesome. 64 MP  camera is true to its name. Single mode is another feather in the cap. The display is awesome and can be read in bright daylight with auto adjustable brightness. It has Knox security and samsung Max which is a VPN to protect your phone from hackers and anything wrong through the internet. The phone is zippy fast. The front camera is also capable of 4k recording . The side key touch is a bit nagging thing though because the way I hold it. The notification alsways comes up as with the slide on the lock button the notification panel opens up. Ignoring this minor glitch the phone is highly recommended for the price range it is available at and biggest of all is it is MADE IN INDIA.

  The Samsung Galaxy M31 managed to make a good impact in the budget segment thanks to its crisp AMOLED display and a big battery, which helped distinguish it from the competition. Samsung has now launched its successor, called the Galaxy M31s. The new Galaxy M31s sports an Infinity-O display and the Single Take camera feature, both firsts for the Galaxy M series. Starting at Rs. 19,499, do these new features justify the higher price? I review the Galaxy M31s to find out.spent the last five days with the Galaxy M31s, and here is my take on the phone.Samsung Galaxy M31s specifications: 6.5-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED display| Samsung Exynos 9611|6GB RAM/8GB RAM, 128GB storage, microSD support included|6000mAh battery, 25W fast charging support|32MP front camera, 64MP main camera+12MP ultra wide camera+5MP depth camera+5MP macro camera||Android 10, OneUIThe Galaxy M31s reminds me of the Galaxy A51 in terms of design language. The front of the phone has an edge-to-edge 6.5-inch AMOLED display and a small hole for the front-facing camera. Flip the phone, and you will notice the rectangular camera bump on the top left – the setup is similar to that of the Galaxy S20 series. On the left side there’s the SIM tray, while on the right, there’s a power button that doubles as a fingerprint scanner and volume rocker. On the bottom, there’s a USB-C port, a speaker and a headphone jack.I buyed for youtube channel review but it's a average good performance  experience give to me

  First usage reviews....Awesome power packed phone.Pros1. The usp of the phone is the finger print reader. Perhaps, I say it is more convenient and faster then face unlock.2. The display is excellent. You really enjoy watching videos on it.3. Battery backup is good and fast charge is brilliant.4. The OS works smoothly.Cons1. Weighs a little more.2. Samsung has given a mono speaker, which I think at this price is not fair. Stereo speakers were expected.Detailed review will be posted after few days of usage.

  Superb mobile by Samsung......Best display,camera,battery in a midrange budget.We can go for it with eyes closed.Best UI, Good processor for its budget,25w fast charging,smart switch,6000mah battery.But the worst delivery package ever.The package was not rolled by a thick sheet or by thermocoal sheet etc....Just covered with a very normal low quality courier cover without any outer package.I had ordered different products around some 25 times in Amazon till now...This time was my highest budget and the package was the cheapest and worst among all....Had little touch issue in the beginning but everything seems fine as of now.They provide big and neatly covered package for some 500rs grocery items but giving this much cheap package for 19k mobile coming from 1200kms is really disappointing.... please keep extra concern on this Amazon....

  Battery drainage issue is there in ideal condition in 1 hour battery drainage is about 5 to 6%. Processor is not heating but lags most of the time .This was the first and last time I brought samsung device. I brought only because of non-chinese device and I believe that they fooled Indian so good. Go for Nokia or any other brand non-chinese  device but believe me. Don't waste money in this crisis time. The internet speed is really slow as it does not support 4g+ it only support 4g volte which is also minus point. All in all totally unsatisfied with the device . Those who brought the phone please complaint to Samsung customer service to enable 4g+ volte as device support but in M series phone they have locked it . It can be enabled by ota update .

  The video stability needs a lot of improvement l, in this price segment these things should be more refined. Also, photos in low inditect sun light or artificial lights needs improvement  as it has noise in the images. I think this is just a image processing thing which can be imlroved with the updates. Else  I simply love ghe phone. Being  a Samsung  member for the past 10 years its been a nice experience.

  I have M30s & M31s both purchase from amazon & amazon service no doubt fast and good. But about Samsung M30s & M31s as per battery 6000MH normally it's huge, but as per my expectation not worth.  If I talk about Samsung service my both mobiles in the service center & 1in from the last 1.5 months due to no part available.  service level os Samsung is the worst and I suggest to all buyers please if your phone by-chance like display broken & any other part physical damage/any kind of damage happen, it will not be going to fix anymore due to part is not available in the market, yes mobile you can buy as much quantity you want.  Samsung is the worst.

  Samsung has released M31s with updated design. Here are the pros and cons after a week of using the phone.Pro:1) The display is best in class and comparable to premium smartphones. If you use the phone in dark mode, you will love the deep black and vivid colours. It's definitely a treat to the eyes. I personally prefer AMOLEDs to high refresh LCDs. Hence Samsung has done a wonderful job here.2) The fingerprint reader is mounted on to power button. Its reachable to the thumb and extremely fast. The buttons are tactile and provide good feedback.3) I get close to two days of battery life with regular use. My usages include social media, YouTube and calls. I use two SIMs with internet always active. Even with continuous usage, it will last more than 9 hours.4) Camera quality is good during day light. Both from Regular and Ultra wide angle camera. During night, the regular camera did decent job. Photos are attached for the same. The selfie is awesome in this phone.5) I was sceptical about the performance considering the processor. But I couldn't find any lag or heating in my day to day use. I am not an avid gamer, hence I can't vouch for this processor to gamers.6) The weight distribution has been good and you won't find the phone to be bulky. It's usable by one hand too.7) Single take, reverse charging, fast charging, triple slot are all the extra features which makes the phone good.Con:The price. Even though I have no complaints about the processor for my day to day use, as they have increased the price of the phone by around 2.5k in comparison to M31 they could have gone for a more powerful processor.Conclusion:If you are a casual user who wants phone for media consumption (Good display+Battery) and don't mind the 19.5k price, you can wholeheartedly go for this. You won't regret.

  Well, I am not much of big user of phones for Games / Photos.I basically wanted to avoid Chinese phone (for reasons best known to all) and actually my earlier phone display got damaged during lockdown time (due to sanitizing).This phone as such when used for last one week, I was initially concerned on battery life as per few of earlier reviews. but to my surprise it give me proper timeline of 2 days with almost 10-12 hrs of mobile hotspot usage for my office work & calls (both audio & video). It still has some 10% battery left after almost 40 hrs of last charging. Also as mentioned it gets almost charged within 2 hrs.Rest honestly have not much tried taking any of monster shots / camera usage hence wont able to comment on that. But yes rest all usage was nice upto expectations. Finger sensor had been really good with my first thumb sensor but other hand finger sensor is not working that properly, may be i will activate it again.Yes, some of samsung pre-installed apps is bit of headache to get rid off it not used.One more thing, if as everyone says yes bit disappointed as there has been no backcover given.Samsung how much it would have taken to give one proper backcover and one earphones too. (is that too much to ask for - no earphones !! really surprised )Finally, yes it's slightly overpriced.. anything around 18K would have been better but 22k is bit 4k on higher side (would not have still not been minding it if proper backcover and earphones if had been given).Overall for me it's a good phone as for now.... hope to review further after an month usage.

  I have used this for 5 days and i these are my observations -1. If you are willing to play heavy games then go with Snapdragon smartphones.2. If you are a business user or using it with normal apps then this is a great option for you.3. The OneUI is very good i can say because it has lot of customisation and very decent to look at.4. Transparent cover is not included so you have to go for other brand cases.5. Phone is handy as it's not that big in size.6. Type C fast charger is there with two sided type C which will help you with reverse charging and can use with laptop having type c port.

  if you are looking for a Smartphone in a medium price range. Then this is the best deal. Samsung has created a very beautiful phone. It's got everything. Got my phone on Saturday, since then I just can't stop using it.It's camera is very clear and takes sharp pictures. Now me being a person who loves taking pictures,I enjoyed capturing beautiful mesmerizing shots with the camera. 64mp gives pictures a clarity like dslr. Ultra wide shot of 12 mp captures every detail and is perfect for capturing a wide shot.The best point about this phone I only had to charge it in the morning,and then I use it for the entire day- taking pictures,capturing moments, playing games like call of duty and while doing all this, I use my Boat Bluetooth Headsets connected with my handset.The battery of this phone is amazing. It really lasts long.The touch and feel of this phone is very premium like Samsung note 10 or iPhone 11.And I really like the color Mirage Blue- it's the mixture of silver and blue.Just one downtown which I found that Samsung hasn't provided any headphones with the handset.Samsung people you should add headphones as well as a good cover for the phone would also be appreciated.All in all I really am enjoying my new phone and exploring it. Just in love with it's camera. It's so amazing.One more thing with this camera you don't need any other camera apps. Samsung has included everything in the camera.

  I ordered for my sister and she is just in love with it....The only major thing is that if I would purchase this from Samsung shop I would have got the earphones and case along with it ...Eventually which is not given here....I don't understand that when everything is manufactured and packed same way then how these packages doesn't have earphones and cover....The rest color and phone is awesome camera is super good the look is classy and awesome u can flaunt your own charging is extra fast like 5-100% in 35-45 mins

  First of all great battery life. I have been using the phone for 8 days now and I need to charge it once in 36 hours only inspite of heavy usage, it takes about  100 minutes for a full change. The camera as expected is really good,  this photo was taken from a moving vehicle at almost  50kmph . The touch is butter smooth and one hand operation is a breeze . The finger print sensor works really  well and the display and colors are wonderful. Specs are best in class .All in all a great phone and i fully recommended it.

  It's been a month now, so far no glitch or problem in the phone except the one i.e. Wi-fii stability. It logs out of the wifii connection frequently like atleast once in an hour and needs to sign in again and again and still couldn't sign in immediately, takes time.Really hope Samsung will fix it with some software upgrade.Now about the highlights of the mobile phone:1. Finger print reader- Fab2. Battery- Excellent, I charge it once in a day, if you are a moderate user, battery would last atleast a day and a half. Thumbs up to battery too.3. Camera: Fabulous camera. No complaints.4. Display screen: The best among all the mobiles in this range.5. Touch: Very smooth and precise.6. Bluetooth connectivity: GoodMost important- Not Made in ChinaOverall loving the phone. 4 stars, 1 star down for Wi-fii stability. Please Samsung send some update on that.

  The phone is dead in the first day itself. I wonder is there any quality control in the Samsung. The phone display stopped working, and sometimes flickering a lot with green, orange lines. The phone even rings and I could be able hear the message tones as well, but screen is dead - not able to even backup anything. Worst Quality. Didn't expected this from Samsung.The phone also comes with lot of bloatware softwares, these get install automatically at the time of setup. Even if we try to skip and cancel - it is not allowing us to do so. Why should we have to live with all unwanted apps.Seems like a marketing fraud - over rated and created hype. Worst build quality.Now I am waiting for the refund.

  After used of 15 days ....Issu...1. Heating issu is big problem on this .2.you think 6000 mah means big battery and runs long but if you used then you get just 1 day battery backup moderate to high used ....like redmis 5000 mah3. 32 mp front camera not up to tha mark .4. It has not own internet speed meter ...you should download 3rd party app5. And also did not get inbult screen recording option ...Favorable.1. Back camera is awesome2. Display is also good3. Some features are impressive like power saving mode (it is differnt not like other phone),notifications on floating window types.4. Face unlock and fingerprints senser both are good5.charging time is just 2 hoursRunning is smooth ...I can say its value for money.

  Amazing processing speed, camera quality is too good. With its clear display and sleek design, it becomes an absolute sassy buy! The color combination used at the back of this phone is perfectly balanced to give it a look, a class apart. A must buy phone in this range.Ordered my phone on 6th August, got it well before the supposed time and in a good packaging. Good work amazon team on the delivery side.Potential buyers, go for this phone without any second opinion!! You won't regret it.

  At the beginning i felt the battery is weak which was getting emptied at the soonest time. Later i found the inner settings of the mobile and it is running good and for me 100% charge is getting consumed for around 25-30 hours. Camera quality is really awesome and have wonderful clarity with high pixels for both rear and selfie cameras. In-built features also good when compared to other similar ranged smartphones. As per my experience and requirement, 6 GB is more than enough. So suggest to purchase 6GB rather than investing extra 2k just for 2GB more. The main reason for me to buy this is not manufactured in China and i was supposed to change the bloody China phone Redmi.Overall this phone is worthy for the 20k compared to other brands for the price. You can purchase this confidentally if you are looking for a good smartphone with best camera and battery smartphone in 20-22 k.

  I have been using the Samsung M31s for a week now. The phone is worth the money you pay. The display is phenomenal. Storage and RAM is good. Camera is decent. Only thing that you will not like is processor if you play games. Or else you will really love this phone. Its not too heavy east yo hold even with case. Battery will last around 1.5 days. This phone can be used as a powerbank also. Speaker sound quality is decent. Fingerprint reader is fast and placed well (Atleast for me).When I unboxed the phone I found that the travel adapter had big scratches and looked like used one. And the Type C cable also had a slight damage. Apart from that Phone was well packed.

   Superb camera and battery life with 25 watt super fast charger.Disappointed with processor  which can be better to replace with Qualcomm snapdragon 765.Body of handset is well designed with color in curved shape.All over awasome experience, after 10 years I choose samsung after improvement.Hope samsung will continues move ahead for next generation demand.

  I m not that satisfied with camera quality as much I was expecting looking at the description of the product. Especially for night mode. Battery life is also running like 4500-5000mh battery. Well there is no lag or performance issues I have noticed so far. I was expecting more features in camera to get better quality image as compared to redmi phones. If you are looking for Samsung or okay to compromise bit with camera quality then go for it. In the end, camera is not too bad, only it is not up to expectations of the advertisement.

  Overall phone is good.Pros: New features and gestures added to the phone are very good.Cons:1. The processor could have been better.2. The main rear camera is a little disappointing. I tried comparing camera with old mi A3 and OnePlus 5t, I get superior photo quality in these 2 older phones and even in old mi A3 budget smartphone. The photos in Samsung m31s captured by rear camera are more whitish and not clear and detailed.Maybe Samsung could fix these camera problems with a new software update. But below 20k mid-range smartphones, the expectations are higher than budget smartphones. And these problems should overcome.

  Been using Samsung galaxy phone for last 4+years. value for moneySamsung M31s is smooth in function, can switch apps with ease with no lag,  battery doesn't heat up, reasonable charging time taken which fast by any standards, thanks to 25W chargeperformance of the camera is at par. clean shot with 64 mp camera, macros are amazing, selfie camera is just great, captures details without altering the details by artistically smoothing or brightening.only con is is a bit heavy when compared to my previous phone Samsung J7 2016.classy appearance.overall good value for money!!! 5 stars

  Don't expect much out of this phone. It's an average phone. It's having hanging issue from the second week onwards. I didn't installed any game. Fingerprint reader is slow. Camera is good on the day light shots. But on low light, you can find lot of digital noise in the photos. Battery life is decent. But charging takes more than 2.5 hours (from 0 to 100%). But in description it is mentioned that it'll take 90 mins to reach 100%. WhatsApp sticker installed can't be used/available in the dual WhatsApp app. On this price range, it doesn't fullfill my expectations.

  Really a good product from samsung except for the higher price. The product feel and quality has to be improved as they make it in Korea originally,since this is an Indian make compromising on quality.

  I bought samsung M31s for my wife..used for two weeks. C is using mobile for story reading and ludo king only. Earlier c used Redmi note 7 pro.1. Camera: 64MP camera is not like 64MP. It's Sony camera. But redmi note 7 pro camera is better. Front camera is good. Then video quality is good.2. Battery: 6000mah!  It's doubt.. it sucks charge very fast. Within 24 hours more than 90% charge is dried. Charging time also around 2 hours it takes. Redmi note 7 pro is better than this.3. Connectivity: it is very poor. While sending text through what's app, After 30 second only it sends text. C s using Jio sim. No signal issues also. Downloading also very slow. ( I am using moto G5 s plus, it performs better than M31s. I am also using Jio sim.)4. Performance: There is lag in performance of mobile.. it's being very slow. It uses extra storage of 6 GB RAM. Already installed apps occupies 2.5 GB. If we install other app means it occupies 4GB out of 6GB.Redmi note 7 pro performed well than this.5. Display : Very good display. No cons about display.. it has good display..6. Finger print: side finger print option is good.  But it is used only for display on, it does not switch of the display. If we put flip cover, we couldn't register thumb impression on finger print scanner.

  While writing this reviews I have already used this mobile more than 20 days .Phone is excellent specially ONEUI 2.1 is fabulous,No ads and no bloatwares.But the processor is little bit old processor, otherwise everything is fine .Go for it without any second thought .One more major point ..Now privacy is one of the biggest fundamental human rights ,which you can't get in Chinese smartphones.They are stealing our data .So nowadays for privacy you have to worry bcoz in smartphone you are carrying a lots of information regarding card information,your heartbit after a run ,your photos ,images ,banking information etc etc..

  Good mobile. Btw all samsung mobiles are same, no difference at all .its the same what I was expecting. I just wanted new mobile as my old phone was 1 year old , so i purchased this on exchange offer.  Dont expect much from any mobile phone.. phone is for calling, messaging and for little time paas when we r alone and not at home. At home I have PC , TV etc that i use for gaming or watching movies.. I use mobile for its main purpose only, so I am not disappointed but price is little bit higher. And same old design. Poor samsung cant make better looking mobiles. Always they make cheap plastic body. And then claminng 64 mp camera, 6 gb ram and bla bla. For taking pictures i use my nikon camera. . I just want phone simple good looking and only for normal use. They cant make 2 stereo loud speaker phone? Then cant make its look better? But they r focused on 256mp camera. And 10 cameras on 1 phone. Jokers :))

  Review after 30days of use:1. Display: Awesome super amoled display, video looks good and colours are displayed with lot of detailing.2. Battery life: Good can spent couple of days without charging.3. camera: Nice clicks from front and back camera both are good.4. Heat: I played games for long hrs and no heating detected.5. Finger print: quickly responds.6. Charger: Complete charge in around 1 1/2hr from zero percent.7. Speaker: Nice and loud. clear music.Cons:1. My eyes gets red after usage and getting little headache, not sure if due to mobile vivid display. because when i changed this to natural i am not facing such issue.Overall: Happy with the product.

  Too much of shutter lag in camera. Few lags seen in few application as well. All other things are great. At this price point a good device. They could have given a more Snapdragon chipset.Update: While playing audio with Android auto there is audio drop(kind of skip). Not sure is this is problem with Android auto or phone Bluetooth while playing music. Was using apple before and music was smooth.

  M31s is an expectation met smartphone. If I define in one word it is ""Superfluous midranger with High speed performance"". Used Samsung, Micromax, vivo phones. But the Camera I have never seen this depth, clarity and saturated color photos in any product so far. SPEAKER has a bass touch in it equaling a Stereo speaker. Its Knox protected mobile. Built quality is super premium. Mirage Blue is defines a Class Flagship premium look. Thanks for the rapid Delivery and Amazon packing was secure. A well justified price for the M31s. So what are you waiting for, order it & u will love M31s liquid LPDDR4x RAM speed & a massive 6000mAh with a INTELLI CAMERA, Samsung has really improved the camera segment in M31s.

  Best budget phone.1. Exynos haters, try to keep your data safe with SD processors. Also big brands like Samsung work on optimization which chinese brands can never. So performance is smooth.2. Pubg hangs after 2 hours even in 855 plus phones so really not worth spending more or relying on chinese brands(who start to decline after 1 year.)3. Camera, display, battery, connectivity, Knox security can't get better in this budget.I personally don't care about Samsung pay or else I would have gone for A51.

  Build-up Quality - 4.5 /5Sturdy phone,and feels premium. You van use it with one hand. Fingerprint reader works like a charm.Screen Quality - 5/5No two views about Samsung amoled screen. Punch hole makes it a class apart.Camera - 4.5/5Camera performance is decent, and very responsive. Used wide angle cam , was able to  take clear n sharp pictures. One click is an added advantage.Processor - 4/5Pubg performance was neutral ( kinda okayish) . However , opening and working on other apps was a breeze.Call quality - 4.5/5Earpiece volume is quite clear n decent. Much better than the previous brands phones that i used.Battery -5/5Perfect -  A game changer. 6000 mah n 25 w super charger is a deadly combination.Interface - 5/5UI is pretty neat, with no bloatwares/ ads.

  The Samsung Galaxy M31s offers stellar value for money and is arguably the best M-series smartphone under 20k. The phone has a great primary camera, fantastic battery life, a crisp and vivid display, capable performance, and good build quality. The dedicated microSD card slot and 3.5mm headphone jack only add to the smartphone's appeal.The macro lens and ultra-wide camera are also quite average. However, these issues are not huge deal-breakers. The Galaxy M31s is a great package overall and Samsung surely has a winner on their hands.

  First of all Delivery from Amazon was pathetic. It was delivered with water on packaging n bit on phone too. When I called customer care they said can't replace it However they will pay back the amount where I have spent time n money n bought it with some coupon.Coming to phone performance its ok and can't say best.  One good thing is its very good camera featured phone with multiple n good option.

  It has been more than a month using this mobile. I was very excited when I purchased this. But its not up to the mark.Although it has 4 cameras with ""64 megapixels"" primary camera, but it is not very good.Ram management is good but processor is slow, very slow.It appears good in appearances but build quality is not good.It does not justify its price, I found very costly.

  Review after 5 days uses.Pros:Display: very good looksvery clear in outdoor as well.Battary: easily give backup for whole day for normal user, for heavsy users it also perform good.Cons:Camera: camera is usp for this mobile but is very ordinary evan my two year old honor plus out perform it in most of cases.Processor: only good for just daily tasks it lags if you play light games like tennis clash.Body: plastic must use case and glass guard.

  1. When you change phone, you look for bigger ram and storage, better camera quality, bigger battery, and nice user interface. This phone cleared all these exams with flying colours.2. overall feel of phone and grip is good in hands. Fingerprint reader is pretty fast and there is no lag in processing. There are lot of customisation option unlike Chinese phones (I don't like those push and force advertisement in MI and other Chinese phones). I switched from ASUS and with this phone I had good experience so far. I recommend this product and brand to all. It may be seems costly in comparison Chinese phone by 500-1000 rs, but you will get support services from one of the reputed brands in india.

  After 2 week usage reviewBeautiful displayGood battery lifeCharger is sufficiently fastNo lag at all in daily uses ( i didn't use it for heavy game like pubg )Amazing rear camera undoubtedly bestFront camers is just okay type seems some software problemNet speed goodNo network problemSound - clear and loud sound in call and musicBiometrics - worst fingerprint sensor ,work sometimes very fast but sometimes it doesn't work and u have to enter pin same goes with Face lock it take more then usual time to identify youOver all good phone at this price if you want to buy a non Chinese phone this is the best option in this prise range it gives you flagship experience (for regular usage like net surfing video streaming, no idea about hardcore gaming)In my personal opinion its better then samsung A51 A71 and one plus nord it has better camera better battery ,3.5 mm jack dedicated memory card slot and then less price comparison to nord

  I extensively researched for a month before purchasing this mobile. I run a company and I was looking for a mobile which can be with me without any maintenance and slowing down for at least 3 years. I cannot afford to change mobile phones every year and I'm already using an iPhone 6s Plus.I was confused with this mobile, Oneplus Nord and realme 6 pro and finally purchased this mobile.Pros:1) The screen quality is Awesome. it is super AMOLED and no less than the flagship series of Samsung.2) The battery life is the second-best point of this phone. The battery lasts at least 1.5 days even with heavy usage.3) Samsun One UI is also great. There are no ads, unlike MI, Oppo and Vivo phones. It offers a lot of customizations and one the easiest to use.4) The camera is not that bad, the camera is not that good as OnePlus Nord but it is not that bad. It has an average camera.5) No Heating issues.6) It can run games easily. I won't say it is the best at handling games but if you are not a gamer, you can run any game on this mobile easily.7) The speaker is big enough.8) Audio quality is simply unmatched, it has Dolby Atmos and with earphones it is awesome.Cons:1)The biggest Con that no will tell you is - it has no Haptik feedback and also Vibration sucks.2) Fingerprint reader and face unlock is not worth it. It is really bad.2) Plastic back is very bad and you need to cover it to save it from damages.3) No earphones, Screen guard and the back cover comes with the phone. Please get the cover on the same day as there can be micro scratches on the phone.4)The phone is heavy and a bit thick.

  You won't get such an awesome phone at this price. I pray the company not to withdraw or increase price of  this phone from the market as this more than worth a flagship phonePROSSee the quality of the image of the food that's captured using M31s. There is nothing more to explain about its camera quality than this.The keyboard has built in audio to type the messages according to our voice. And this works in all apps.As far finger print is concerned its very fast. I had been using vivo z1x, IPhone 11, OPPO, etc. But the finger print speed is lightening.Also face unlock. In this phone it has an extra feature to add alternate face. Its similar to adding 2 faces or with mask or make up and without the same. Also it has an option for open eye to unlock.Among this range phones of Samsung,  it has always on display, which was lacking in samsung mid range bands. I like it too much.The look of the phone is quite like a flagship phone. We feel the built is with metal or glass and it is fantastic.The super amoled display is like liquid display. Finger flows freely.About the speaker, even the ring tone itself has a rich tone. We long for hearing music again and again.The full screen view of videos is awesome. We not even notice the camera hole in it.CONSonly three fingers can be added. If there is an option to add attract 10 fingers,  it would be even better.

  See in this price one cannot get everything right, so Samsung has offering for best camera, display, and battery in this price.I must say camera is one factor which is hard to master in low price, even one plus struggle to give best cam in 30k.So camera is top highlight, then the quality of display it has. Is surely amazing to this price.The ui experience is surely amazing, if you have never used one ui then it's hard for you to understand but this is best ui, with high level in customisation and top level security.Performance is also good if not awesome. In my opinion it's one of the best phone in its price. One can go with it and I am sure will not get disappointed.????

  Battery life and fast charging is excellent. Phone runs upto 2 days with single charge for me  with an average screen time of 6 hrs per day with sync, gps and mobile data turned on.  Camera is also good (especially the features like pro,  slow motion and time laps ). but sometimes I felt camera application is slow. Phone is good enough for daily usage when battery is less. I'm using more than 55 applications other than the preinstalled applications haven't noticed any difficulties in multi tasking. I have played PUBG too, but it was not that great experience because of heating issue after continuous usage.The side mount fingerprint scanner is a excellent feature especially easy when using bigger phones. But sometimes its tricky especially when ur hand is slightly wet or something as compared to the back mount ones.Camera, battery life and infinity o sAMOLED display are the features I love in this phone

  NOT A TECHNICAL BUT AN HONEST USER EXPERIENCE AS YOU HAVE TO TAKE A BOW ITS LONG LASTING BATTERY LIFE, BEST PERFORMANCE & VIVID CAMERA QUALITY RESULTSBATTERY LIFE:The previous generation samsung phone had only 1 problem i.e., of battery. This has now completely resolved. I use my personal phone same as I use my laptop. Every transaction, business work, personal stuffs name it. Still, due to heavy usage of phone, battery lasted for as much as 48 hours!!!! Can't get any better deal than this at this price.CAMERA:With a quad camera setup of 64 MP, you can snap some of the great memories with your phone. I am more into scanning the documents from a phone than taking snaps of nature and this phone has not discouraged me any way.PROCESSOR:Heavy usage of phone has not discouraged me either in processor. I am not a techno savvy guy still I can write that this phone has got nuts in performing multi-tasking.BUILD QUALITY:Corning gorilla glass and sturdy body frame of phone has not upset me either. Yes phone was drop by me mistakenly on day 1 still no crack or break.What else do you need in a 20-22k price range? Samsung Galaxy M31s is a complete all in one package!!!

  Used this mobile for about 3 weeks and then writing this review.The mobile battery is very good and long lasting. Normal use for about 1-2 hours a day will only reduces its battery to 5-10% when fully charged.Camera quality is awesome.One shot mode is good for travelling but I didn't used it much.I used the 8 GB variant so mobile didn't hanged at all.Audio and video quality is very good.Mobile is bit heavy but that's not bad about that because if you chose 6000mAh battery mobile it is obvious that it becomes heavy.I think it's worth buying this product.But beware of duplicate products if the outer seal of the box is tempered please return it as soon as you got the parcel, don't wait for anything.Moreover this review is based on my personal experience, and it may vary from person to person. According to my budget it's worth of money.

   Phone has good finish, a lot better than M31.Awesome screen resolution and crystal clear sharp display.Very good camera, nice daylight photos. Have not dont much night time or low light photography yet.Very good long lasting battery backup and also the battery charges up fully within an hour from zero or 5-10%.Fingerprint reader on side is cool feature and also very responsive.All n all loved the phone and found it value for money.A lot better than other Chinese competitors.

  The very first impressions about and overall spec is good.But when go in detail and once start using it will start feeling the weakness of the phone.1. 6k mah battery still not effective as the process is not efficient.2. Frequently internet get disconnect and even the network go blank and I missed lot of calls.3. Even the same problem with Bluetooth connectivity.4. Camera 64 mp is just doesn't give any crisper photo when go on detail.Im writting this review after using this phone for a month.I really got disappointed.

  The overall experience with the Galaxy M31s is great. I like the overall features of the phone specially the feather touch on the screen. For those who are looking for a battery life its a huge disappointment.Two major disappointments:1. Since the phone is new in the market, Samsung should have provided a better experience with One UI 2.5 or 3.0. But there seems to be no plans for the UI upgrade.2. I am a heavy user and the only reason for buying the phone was the massive 6000mah battery. But it seems to be a pretty much disappointment from Samsung. I have been using the phone for a week now and the battery does not perform as expected. I don't play games on the phone but daily uses like Paytm, google pay, Teams, Outlook, Gmail, WhatsApp. The battery does not long even for 8-9 hours. I am sure that it is a paid promotion from the vloggers that they mention about the 2-day battery life. I was expecting the phone to be charged every 2 days, but I have to charge the phone every day. If I want to have a 2-day battery then I have to use very cautiously like not using wifi, WhatsApp, or any sort of heavy use.

"
  Battery life is toooo bad...drains very fast.Camera effects is the best thing which is added in this phone
",,
"
  Let's start with pros:Battery - My battery runs for around 48 hours with normal call flow & messages/ WhatsApp, around 1 hour of gaming, 1 hour of Amazon Prime, etc.Camera - Camera output is awesome. Single take feature is superb. It shares 1 best shot, 1 small video, 1 super fast video and 1 reverse video. Front camera is equally good.RAM & ROM - I'm using 8GB & 128GB phone & its performance is up to mark.Sound - Sound is not very extra ordinary for music lovers but when you use speaker for normal calls - it works fine. This phone also has FM radio which most of the companies are not offering now a days.The best feature is placement of finger print sensor. It's at the side of handset - right under the volume control. The placement of this sensor make its use quite handy.Let's go for cons:The only con I could find out is non-availability of a good back/ flip cover. In my view Samsung should start manufacturing the cover along with the handset and bundle it with handset for ease of it's customers.

  This is one of the best Android phones under budget.Camera quality with 64 megapixel covers wide angle photographs with really good quality. Also capability of recording 4k videos with no delays adds to the fun of making awesome videos.It has fingerprint reader and face recognition to unlock. Fingerprint gets dusty sometimes with usage, but works pretty well.The battery life is amazing. Full charge easily carries the normal phone usage to 30 hours.Overall its a very good phone under 20000.

"
  It is a phone which is jack of all trades master of none.Battery is goodCharging speed is goodHardware performs well for day to day tasks.Camera ain't that good.No heating issues.Just phone takes time to boot up.Net speed is slow when the phones restarts after switching off.So give two minutes after switching on and then try internet .

  Pros -1.Display is awesome one would love this.2. Camera quality is very good.3. Side Fingerprint scanner work very well but it takes 2-3 days to get used to that.4. Have some super cool features such as Blue Light Filter, Music share (Can be used only other phone has similar feature)Cons -1.Processor is very slow. Even one plus 3, 4 years old phone processor was super fast as compared to this one. Probably Ram management is not that good in this phone.2. You cannot remove some preloaded apps in this one even if you want to.3. A bit bulky and thick and after adding cover you may find it as ok ok phone.4. Had to add Nova launcher for customisation. One UI v 2.1 is not that cool if you have gone through using one plus Oxygen or Motorola stock android. One cannot change the opening of apps page from Horizontal to Vertical. Finding the app becomes a bit issues.5. Selfie images are not real and seems one has done some makeup to make them better.

  *Detailed Review *Ohkay so in am gonna start with saying in regards with people who want to buy this phone for gaming purpose.So i would recommend  that please look another phone for that because  exynoss is not made for you .Then i am gonna talk about camera.As per a phone worth 20k camera is not worth it in terms of low light images.Talking about Security so i havent received any knox along with it not sure how other people said that they got one. But this phone do have a huge amount of unwanted applications  and UI is not as great as expected  but decent.I am huge huge disappointed with battery life because its draining really fast.Like when i started writing this with usual speed i have seen 2 percent reduction in battery  and my phone doesnt even have many apps its just whatsap and insta nothing much. Still not sure why is it draining.So maybe a scam with 6000 mah branding.Design is decent but indisplay finger print scanner would be appreciated.Because side mounted is slow and dont even talk about  the face unlock.Display is massive and amazing. Sharp colors and pretty amazing display but not sure if i drop it someday then whts gonna happen because its just corning gorilla glass 3.Looks like Samsung is living in 2015.No headphones  no tempered no protection .This is wierd. I mean  customers can atleast expect something out of box insted of charger and sim ejecter tool. Like common. Atlest give us temprory sim protection  .Because it can get scratched so easily .Please Samsung think about customer a bit....Final verdict.Phone is good enough for people like me who are just gonna use social media and netflix on phone and a decent camera use.Please dont expected something else from this.

  * Display (4.5/5) : Super AmOLED. Rating : 4.5/5 for not having higher refresh rate.* Battery and charging (5/5) : 6000mah massive battery charges at 25w in-box charger, takes around 80-90 minutes for 0-100% at phone switched off. Provides around 8 hrs of SoT.* Processors (3.5/5): Exynos 9611 (10nm, 8 cores, 4 at 2.3 GHz, 4 at 1.7 GHz). Not suitable for heavy gaming. Good for average user.Built (3/5): Plastic frame, plastic back, Corning Gorilla Glass 3 at front. Back is glossy, feels oily, and fingerprint magnet and gets scratched easily with coins, key chains in pocket. Samsung should provide backcover in box.Camera (4/5) : Sony's IMX682 noticed to be improved that from M31's Samsung sensor. Lacks details at low light and cropping.Overall good phone at this budget.

  I received my Samsung Galaxy M31s (Mirage Black / 8GB / 128 GB) on 18-Aug-20 and writing this review after 1 month of usage.Pros:1. Look wise and colour excellent 5/52. Camera 4/53. Speaker and Sound 5/54. Battery 5/55. Performance 4/5. A common man can not trace out any negative point easily as this phone fulfils all his/her need that is needed by 80-90% of people. Remaining 10-20% would fall under techie category and they would not be satisfied by having sky in their hands too.6. OS Experience 5/5Cons:1. Little bit bulky compare to other phones. But, if your look at other pros then this tiny issue gets nullify.Verdict : Overall phone is very good and value for money. Whatever we paid we got it. No regret at all. Guys if you are a Samsung fan and want to go with 20K budget around, then trust me you would not be disappointed. So, no more thinking and worry ness anymore. Go for it, order and grab it??

  This is the first phone I've bought online and I am extremely happy with the service by Amazon and Samsung.BEST THINGS ABOUT THIS PHONE:> At this price range, the features that Samsung Galaxy M31s offers are top-notch.> The camera quality is quite awesome.> The battery is getting fully charged after 40-45 mins of charging.> The feel of this phone is pretty good too. It is sleek, lightweight and easy to carry.This is the best phone in this price range and I would surely recommend it.

  Good quality product from Samsung camera is good  after usage it is working fine for multiple apps and gaming is decent I loved the figure print scanner and face unlock facility as it is quick as compared to 6000 mah  battery it drains faster as my expecting a more time can use normal battery for 2 days but if your using videos and gaming then don't expect  that overall a good productBetter to stand by against Chinese products

  The phone is an all rounderPros:Camera : Single shot, slow motion and ultra slow motions are very good options.Battery : Battery comes for one full day even with heavy usage .Gaming : Game lancher is something good and can play games withmaximum graphics. COD.Cons: Some features like switching between Wifi networks automatically is mising which would have been good if received.Over all a very good phone for the price range. If you want a monstor battery, Gaming and camera go for it.

  First of all ,Beautiful display! Makes u feel as if u are using a flagship phone. Bright vivid screen! Watching movies and series on this one is an amazing experience! If content viewing is your priority ,then go for it!Battery life is awesome!Camera performance is top notch! Both front and rear cameras are brilliant. Single take feature is very helpful.Side fingerprint sensor is very practical.Processor is the only -ve aspect of this phone. Snapdragon processor would have been a killer ,but for day to day activities the Exynos 9611 is good and capable enough. U might see some lag in heavy games thats y this phone is not for gamers at all.Overall a brilliant all round phone from Samsung!

  Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using it for a week And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Fingerprint Sensor:Having integrated fingerprint sensor with power button it feels awesome and works always!!Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.

  I have used this Mega Monstar for over a month now and if you are confused and reading this comment you will get all your answers, answered.Camera Performance:I will not get into the number but this phone camera is best in 20,000 price bracket in comparison to any other phone in this competitions. The HDR, Dynamic Range all things are captured very good. Sometimes struggle in low night but will do the job other wise.Performance:Exynos 9611 before the launch i hoped Samsung would have upgraded this processor beacuse we have seen this processor in other phones as well but they didn't.But now after using it i don't have any problem with it's performance. I only notice a lag in switching from camera to any other app and will tell you that this processor is good enough for a medium user but if you play games for more than 2hrs. you will see a few lags and then phone performance declines and other than that performance is good.Battery life:(I should tell you that charge this phone at night and then use it for the rest of the day worry free!)This phones gives me screen on time over 11hrs. a day and i use my phone for entertainment purposes like Netflix, YouTube, Prime Video's, Hotstar etc. And it's great at night i usually go to bed with 20-30% battery left.Display:I would have said the best display in 20,000 but now Realme 7 Pro also have Samoled display and Finger Frint sensor in the display which look's cool but is not as fast a Samsung Galaxy M31s. So for display there you have one phone competing with it.Phone does have HDR10 as i haved checked it.If you love to watch your content on you phone M31s should be your pick.Knox Security/Security:Phone does show Knox Security but you will not get all the features of Knox in it there are one or two features that you can use of Knox Security otherwise other features are not visible to you but knox make phone secure very much in comparison to other Chinese phones.Design:I have Mirage Black colour and phone looks very cool. Handling is also good. And other than any other M series phone this phone have a frame ( Plastic one) and glastic back basically a polycarbonate back.Final verdict:I will definitely recommend you this phone for it's Camera, Display, Battery and overall user experience. Once you start using Samsung phones and there OneUi there's no going back for sure.

  Battery life is average as it has 6000 mah but not worth it because i have already use 5000 mah max pro m2 from Asus .Battery optimisation require.Camera quality is best but it has complicated software experience.Fingerprint reader position should be under the display but side finger is also good but lack of authentication sometime.I don't want to talk about the exynos 9611 because it is a old chipset from 2018 ,processd sometimes laggy .Phone has everything all we need, but need proper update to control all the process.Showing knox security in start but there is no secure folder.Overall I can say it is a worthy smartphone to buy................4/5 ratings as per my opinion.

  I am writing this review after use of 10 days. Finger print reader response is very quick and operating is hassle free as it is fixed with power/lock key. Battery life is much better but phone consumes battery too much and hence u can expect a power of maximum for 2 days even though it has monster battery of 6000 Mah. Camera quality is just best, may it be rear camera or front one. You won't be disappointed. Its touch is smooth and having quick response. Overall the phone in this range is best but not for heavy gamers.

  Must buy flagship phone at 21,500/-It took 20 days to reveive phone but received in as per estimated date.I am multimedia user so i am completely happy with the display ,finger print touch response is great and battery life and camera quality is just amazing. Its my first time i am using samsung and i have no regrets. Its classy phone. Yes little heavier side but you get awesome battery backup and feels like you actually holding something. You will need to buy cover for it as it can easily get scratches at the back panel.

  A huge upgrade for me, especially when you are replacing old Chinese Redmi 4. The quality of the display is just awesome.  And so is the overall build quality. And you get super fast charger bundled with it. The wide angle camera is also good. The only con which I noticed is that there is no back cover bundled with this package. And since it is a newly launched product, there are not much options available as of now as far as the back cover and tempered glass is concerned. The back of the phone is a fingerprint magnet.The phone delivers an everlasting experience. And I love the dedicated memory card slot.

  I had searched budgetd phone (20-30 k ) for around 2 months and then decided to go with this...decisions was influenced with Indian - China movement too and canceled Nord and ordered this.I am working professional and Mideocare gamer too..1. Screen or Display - 4/52. Typing or keypad- 3/53  Camera - 3.5 / 5 ( 64 Mega is a myth )4. Gaming - Above Avergae5. Speed - Mideocare as expected from samsung processersMy biggest trouble is that it's not property supporting LTE or 4G network. Before this my 4G was working well with previous device on this it's not stable. Surprisingly it doesn't have 4G only mode under network setting hence it's  always picks up or switch to 3G only....attaching picture of network settingIf you are not bothered about cheenese products go for Snapdragon processers only..

  The best smartphone at this price range bundeled with 6000 mAh with 25 watt fast charger ( Using samsung for the first time and loving it).Fingerprint reader is fast. For me battery lives upto 24 hr. If i do my normal tasking and with heavy usage it lives long 8_10 hr. Finding Samsung's one UI core version very user freindly and addictive. Camera quality is very cool. Shoots quality of pictures with proper details and single shot feature is pretty cool. Loving superamoled display

  Likes:Amoled Screen, Battery Backup, side mounted fingerprint sensor, Rear Camera , new Camera features.Dislikes:Plastic back panel, selfie camera could've been more powerful, old processor, no preapplied screenguard or back cover out of the box.Overall the phone is good, if you are ok with the above dislikes... This phone is for moderate users who use fb,insta,YouTube etc. Not for hardcore gamers. Built quality is better than other plastic back phone of samsung.

  Its good the phone isnt bulky i was surprised by the ease of handling and the One UI 2.1 is buttery smooth the oxygen os has its pros but the ONE UI is the most secure UI. The finger print reader is fast and accurate.. the camera is good the sony sensor gets the job done. My three issue were1) Pricing2) colour3)the vintage exynos 9611For this exynos the pricing is just exhorbitant the phones is smooth tho

  I purchased this mobile on 6th August and got it delivered on 11th. Since that day I am facing battery Drainage issue. It is not like 6000mAh battery at all. It is performing like it is having 4000mAh battery. I tried for replacement but Amazon doesn't fulfill replacement orders at my given address. Then I cannot understand why the hell they delivered it to me. I don't want to return and take the return because except that battery issue I don't have anything to complain about.I bought this phone at 17k and if I return it and order it again, I need to pay extra 2.5K. Poor service by Amazon.

  The phone's performance is great. Smooth functioning. Really ultimate battery. Initially felt Slightly high cost when compared to other equivalent mobile phones in the market. But after using it for a week about, felt value for money. Barring the outdated processor and high SAR value, no cons at all. Great phone to have.

  Had been waiting for this for a long time with all the features that suits my lifestyle. The back panel color shade is truly eye capturing and what to say about the battery. Never had a phone with such battery and so many smart features that last for over 48 hrs with normal usage. Overall a beautifully designed smart #Monster from Samsung.

   Camera quality is good... don't expect like Sony, color contrast and senses working good... sufficient for this prize range... actually I was received the product yesterday and photos not captured yet... will be up load after capturing... and O notch display is really good...Finger print sensor is superb working... I was used Samsung A 50 before I bought this, in display finger lock Samsung not working as expected but this side monitoring sensor working excellent and battery life is good cause its 6000mah battery you already knows and its light weight in our hands like freely carries, videos and picture clarity is good as expected and I'm uploading video to show you... totally you will be satisfied to buy it... if any cons I will upload after usage... use the tempered glass witch has i shown you in pics, it will perfectly fit to your mbl m31s, if you want to buy 3d, 6d glass you will regret after usage cause we want pocket friendly tempered glass right?

  Ordered on 15th August & was delivered on 27.08.2020.Good feel in hand. Looks sleek & 1st appearance is impressive.Highlight is Battery with 8gb ram & 128 gb storage....Fingerprint reader is sensitive. I didn't find any lag. May b bcoz it's now? Upon aging will know better.Camera is jus ok.4/5Overall it's impressive.... @21.5 K(certainly the Chinese mobiles give more value for money but still they r Chinese)Complete feedback after 6 months...

  I shifted from MiUi to Samsung's One Ui after 5 years and I can see the difference. The Ui is quite Bulky and feels heavy with all the animations (you can reduce them altho). So the fast refresh rate while scrolling through the apps is quite visible. This is the only change I felt that I would rate among the Cons.Would Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a mobile with great camera and more importantly great On screen experience. The screen is just WOW you can't compare this with any other mobile in this price segment. So Non gamers with high battery demand here you go, this is made for you.

  Phone is overall good in aspects of display, camera ,battery ,figurer print senser and face unlock works very well , but phone shows lags and this is the only major problems,(phone is light,good looking and over all a good pice at 21500?) features are also some what better than other m series phones.  I think for a normal user (like me) it is okey but for gamers it isn't good. This phone can only be compared with -redmi note 9 pro max ,Pico m2 pro because of its qualities...If you are a daily life worker than i will suggest buy this..(ban chinies goods)

  Touch is very slow... Application loading time is to high..Eventhough RAM is 8 gb performance is very poor..camera not having a clarity of 64mp ...Overall don't go for this m31s..

  Writing the complaints only:1.Side mounted Fingerprint scanner is small, thus detection is not as good as the rear mounted or on display Fingerprint sensors, out of 10 trials it will detects 6 times only.2.On normal usage the battery lasts bout 1.5 days & heavy 1 full day, but the mobile feels heavy.3.Colors are highly boosted, not to my choice. In some photos the shades were totaly different then the actual color.4.Samsung Keyboard doesn't provide any haptic feedback. Typing feels bad.

  This phone is extremely good. I solely bought it because of its excellent Ram management and of course for its amoled screen. I'm not a huge gamer, so for everyday usage the phone performs upto the mark. Below I'll list some of its best and not so good specifications.Battery life is really good. It last a whole day with back to back usage from some light games to videos, music, heavy browsing and hours of calls. So battery is 5/5Camera quality is also quite good. Although it struggles a bit in low light but the overall output is really good. You need to use the ""Pro"" mode (if you're familiar with DSLR) to get the best out of the phone camera. Selfie camera isn't the best out there given the fact that it's 32mp. It's decent enough and intellicam is quite useful. So for camera I'd give 4/5.Ram management is the best out of the lot. Although it takes up a lot of power and ram, the switch from one app to another and back and forth is smooth and consistent. I'd rate full 5/5 for RAM.The display although amoled is a bit yellowish. You'll see the yellowish tint clearly on a full white background. And no it's not the settings. I've tried every settings out there possible but it's not the settings. It has more to do with the phone than the settings. Compare it with some other phones and you'll definitely notice the difference. But other than that, the display is very immersive. Display I'd rate 4/5.Now coming to the downside:Phone is quite heavy. I know, it has a big battery and as a result it tends to be heavy. So to each their own.The screen to body ratio is not the best out there. I'd say M31 screen to body ratio is better than M31s. It has an aspect ration of 20:9. In simple terms, it's taller but not wide enough. So some apps might not work well with that ratio.And yes, if you're ordering this phone, then bundle it with a back cover. It's a must with phones like this.Overall I'm quite happy with the phone. The pros outweighs the cons. And all phones will have its cons. So if you want to buy this phone for its pros then I'd say go for it. It's a solid phone compared to other brands. You'll really feel the difference if you compare with other phones. It's worth buying.

  Pros:Super Amoled DisplayGood Enough BatterySamsung Brand Value4+1 Camera UnitCons:Exynos 9611 processorGlastic Back PanelNot so super fast chargerVery poor signal receptionSo samsung and some tech reviewers hyped this device somuch. But it doest not live upto the expectations. It has the Sony IMX sensor, but it doest not produce true colors. If i take a pic of a red color, it shows you light orange tint. I was so excited with the marketing hype and bought it. The processor utterly disappointed me. At this price range(below this in fact) other brandings are coming up with Qualcomm Snapdragon Chipset, i still dont understand why samsung imposing their own Shitset to the user. People say, it is good for daily usage, i din even ay high graphical games, u can even notice the lag while switching apps. The processor is a complete garbage.And coming to the back panel, i know they cant provide glass to maintain the weight balance, but atleast it cud have been improved. It is very prone to scratches. It feels as if ur own fingers could damage the back.The Super Amoled Display is still protected with Gorilla Glass 3 while other are using GG5. The main plus point is the display itself. Buttery smoothy(only when processor is that smoother of course).Another main problem is the signal reception, its very poor.Dont expect battery to last for 2 days as Tech People are hyping it. Its just one day battery.And it feels as if its over priced. 16k wud have been a great deal.I bought this with somuch of excitement and simply it ruined me. Ive used it for one month and sold. If you still want samsung and can afford a lil more, go for m51.

  The main reason for me to buy a Samsung phone is its reliability. Have been using for 3 weeks and didn't run into any issue and the performance is good. The fast charger does it job well though I didn't do any measurement. The battery is long lasting. With my low-to-moderate use, it easily lasts for 3 days I think.- I find the phone quite good looking and Inifinity-O display makes it better. It is easy to handle. The back is slippery, so a back-cover is a must.- Fingerprint sensor on the power button makes unlocking phone natural, although one wishes it was a bit smarter (e.g. turn on the screen when *pressing* the power button, instead of unlocking which can be a bit annoying).- I didn't use camera much yet, and am not a pro. So, it's hard for me to say if the quad-camera setup elevates the photography experience to the next level. Tried the single-take and liked it somewhat.- Speaker is good enough for listening to music. Didn't try the dolby experience using earphones yet.- Some of the Samsung Apps have useful features, not found in the stock Android apps I used earlier. I especially like the ability in messages app to select and delete multiple messages. Also, the useful cards and category features are good.- The Galaxy Store auto-installs some apps like MX Taka Tak, Snap Chat (not everyone wants these apps!) and tries to trick you into installing it on different occasions. But, it's not difficult to choose not to.- The phone app is integrated with an opt-in spam-protection service, Hiya, providing a (limited) alternative to TrueCaller.- In terms of connectivity, the only feature I found missing is NFC, although I have never really used it on other phones too.Overall, I am satisfied with this phone and will recommend it. My reason for buying this model (over previous M model) were: bigger battery, fingerprint sensor on the side, and better camera.

  Let's make review simpler.Pros:1. Of course, It's a beautiful Amoled display. I loved its punch hole display. Colors are vibrant and brightness is superb.2. As Compared to its predecessor Samsung improved OneUi 2.0 a lot. Its actually a good looking custom skin now with very few bloatwares. It got some very handy gestures and a beautiful Always on Display.3.  Its Battery life is great, I don't see any reason to turn off my data or to turn on battery saver mode.4. Charging speed is not as fast as oneplus or Realme but still Its charging speed is okay. I charged it from 0 to 100 percent in 93 minutes. Fully charging a 6000mah battery in 1.5 hrs is not that bad,5. Fingerprint reader is great, It works well even on  wet fingers.Cons:1. Front camera is a total disaster, back camera is just average.2. Mono speaker is loud enough for call alerts but not for media.3. Like front camera, Face id is useless, It works 2/5 times.4. No Gcam api support.5. A little pricey.Conclusion:Its a little pricey but still I'm giving it 4/5 stars because i was actually impressed with its beautiful AMOLED display, Colors are sharp and Vibrant. There are a few cons mainly related to its camera but like me you want a phone with good display, Full day battery life then go for it. I'm no gamer still PUBG and COD works well on medium settings, Camera performance is great in daylight conditions but as the sun sets its camera set down too.You can gt many better phones under 20k if you want a phone for gamiing but if your primary focus is not gaming, go for it.

  1. Monster battery was what I thought honestly thinking that I'll get a backup of 4-5 days with this 6000 mah battery but still it's decent with 1.5 days backup on regular use.2. Camera quality is good but not ""one plus"" good especially in low light settings. However, is a decent pass off3. Very handy mobile. Easy to use.4. Loved the fingerprint scanner. Amazing sensitivity.Overall a 4/5 from my side. Enjoy the mobile.It's a good bit in the budgeted mobile category for 6/8GB smartphones
",,
"
  Where do I begin.....the phone has so many good things that the few major faults that it has can nearly be overlooked. The fingerprint sensor works extremely well even through a case, as for the camera,the camera is not built into the phone, the phone is built onto the camera with extremely good night mode,hyperlapse,super slow motion and extra stable video recording, what else could one want, it has some helpful features for my wellbeing like wind down(greyscales the screen),blue light filter etc. It ensures my usage does not affect my health. Overall a very good buy the only problem I have faced so far is its unusually short battery life for 6000mah out of the box, but it can be rectified but putting apps in sleep or deep sleep categories,to top it off it comes with McAfee anti-virus.

  After using this phone for 5 days and exploring its every side, firstly I'd like to talk about the design, it feels super premium to hold like any flagship device of Samsung.2. Talking about the display, It just outstands, The blacks are deep blacks because of the super amoled display, play any youtube video in Full HD and you'll witness an immersive experience.3. Fingerprint is super fast, no doubts there.4. The glance on samsung feature on lockscreen makes this phone interesting in a way (Not sure everybody will relate to this)5. Talking about the rear camera quality. It is just amazing, I've attached samples(Normal & Wide angle, night mode) and you can see the quality of the pictures. I'll give 5/5 for it.6. Front Camera performs really good too but in good lighting conditions only. In low lighting it struggles a bit but not too much. It will do a decent job there.7. Battery of this phone is massive. I'm a heavy user and before going to bed at night, I manage to have atleast 30 percent of battery after full day of usage which is quite good.8. Charging time is also very less. It takes around 105 minutes to full charge from 0 to 100. It takes only 20 minutes to charge it 30%. For example : If you plug in the charger at 50% battery level, it will give you 80% battery in just only 20 mins which is quite good especially if you want to leave for somewhere and you have to charge your phone in a hurry.9. Dolby atmos (earphones only), Sliding notification from fingerprint sensor, The speaker sound quality and loudness are some underrated features of this phone.10. I ordered mirage blue because black variant wasn't available but I'm in love with this colour. It is better and more attractive than the black variant. So if anyone was having a doubt regarding this or waiting for the black variant, go for the mirage blue. You won't regret.11. I can actually say for this phone that this is a 'Value for money' product.

  Pros :Finger print is awesome.Display is good .Its really weightless in hands , even though it's 203g ,it feels like 185.Camera is good.Earphone effect is also good .Cons:This is not really the one UI , its one UI core which is a lite version , so inbuilt applock is not there , the applock provided by Samsung in their store really sucks.Its is really a stock android feel but could have included some gestures , which is a big missing in this.

  I have ordered 6GB/128GB model. Colour that I bought is blue.Display - ExcellentBuilt quality - FairBattery - ExcellentFingerprint- PoorCamera - Good (As per price range)UI - GoodProcessor - Poor (Holding the phone back)So as far as experience is concerned, the phone does stutter here and there. The camera's are good as far has the price category is concerned. Two things that are holding the phone back from becoming best midranger is built quality and processor.

  I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 megapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturation. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it, u will not regret,  I promise.

  I have been using this phone for a few months now and this is surely a great phone by Samsung. I had bought the Mirage blue variant which I should say give this phone a premium touch. The fingerprint reader just unlocks the phone with no problem at all and the reader being on the power button just makes it more easy it use and doesn't miss the finger anytime. The battery life of this phone is too good as it easily runs a day even if I keep continuously using it ( and I do rough use). The 6000mah battery has got the power surely and the 25w charger chargers the phone in just 97 minutes which is amazing. The smartphone has a Super Amoled display which no question is superb to use. The smartphone has four rear cameras: a 64MP Intelli-Cam primary camera, a 12MP ultra-wide lens, a 5MP macro lens, and a 5MP depth sensor. The front camera stands at 32MP. The cameras have a lot of functions like Live focus, AR doodle, slow motion and many more. The camera demands a praise as the photos produced are of great quality and clarity. The Single Shot function is something innovative Samsung has come up with. I had heard by some Tech reviewers that the processor should have been upgraded at this price point but I didn't seem to have any problem while using the phone. I am having fun using this phone and for sure this is a great buy for me. If you are looking for a good phone under 20k with a premium touch, great battery life and great camera quality this is the one and thumbs up(Not a chinese brand).

  Simply put, If you have an M30 /something in that or lower segments and want an upgrade under 20k, this phone is your best bet if you are not interested in buying phones from China Based Brands.* The camera is pretty decent but not the best.* Battery Backup is good* Functions Smoothly* It heated up after an hour of file transfers* Its heavy and therefore causes a lil discomfort.* Unlocks smoothly* The display is impressive

  PROS:-1. Great camera2. Good headphone output (basically the presence of Dolby Atmos , makes it a great entertainment device.)3. Humangus 6000mAH battery4. Great user experience , I think One UI is far better and optimise for this device , also for M21/31, than MIUI11/12.5. 25W fast charging , (0-100% takes almost 2h30m)6. Great Super Amoled display, great contrust, great viewing angle.CONS:-1. Bad build quality, after using 15 days back cover got scratches easily, though it looks looks batter , but I think at this price range Samsung have to gone with glass back2. Poor WIFI / CELLULAR connectivity ( LOW SAR VALUE)3. THOUGH IT RUNS SMOOTHLY WITH EXYNOS 9611 , but it is now 1 year old processor.

  I am using this phone from 4 days and its display,camera and battery are the best under 20k its better than poco x2 in everything except processor.Actually there is flickering issue while recording slow motion  video thats a small bug.

  Pros : 1. Display is superb  2.

User interface is very nice and simple4. Camera performance is good in bright sunlight and outdoor (only restricted to day light )5.Build quality is decent6.No heating issues7.Charging speed is good and charges quickly 10 -100 in max 70 minuteCons : 1.Processor,considering this price range ,very low end, (for day to day use its ok)2.

  I got my Samsung m31s on prime day order. It has a 6.5-inch super AMOLED display which is very immersive and stunning.  I am really impressed with a mobile fingerprint which is quite very fast, mobile has a 6000mah battery which gives 8hr to 9hr life with heavy calling, video playing, various applications use, and more. The image quality of the camera is good, its depth sensor and ultra-wide are amazing. I love the single take option of this phone. I am really sad that they don't give tempered glass and mobile case, in this price range all smartphone company gives this item. Samsung should give this item. If I talk about price then it should be 1000 or 1500 less than the present price. ????

  Looks premium with minor updates according to the CURRENT technological advancements.Look good, camera good, battery good, processor definitely not so good u can feel the difference in day to day usage.Update after 7 days use....Honestly disappointed. Phone shows lag in day to day activities. Fingerprint scanner is also slow and inaccurate. U can only store 3 fingerprints. I don't game at all so can't comment on that. Battery is good, 25w fast charging is a boon. Camera is decent. Photos are good. Videos are not. Speaker of phone is Loud enough. I think i am more disappointed than impressed at 19,499rs.

  The Samsung Galaxy M31s is by far the best smartphone that Samsung has to offer. It is a marriage between the affordability and practicality of the M series with the style and flagship features of the A series. The phone comes with an exceptional Camera, monster battery which has been giving me minimum 10 hours backup with heavy usage in video calls and multitasking.  While most reviewers and gurus are condemning the use of the Exynos 9611, as a verified buyer and a multitasker with heavy productive use, I didn't  find any lag or inconsistency  in the processor.  It has excellent RAM and battery management  . The 9611 shouldn't  stop you from buying this phone as it is a complete package.  Moreover, in light of data breaches and the push for data localisation, the phone comes with KNOX hardware which is unheard of at this price.  KNOX along with the trusted name of Samsung makes this phone the must buy at this price point. It has an exceptional battery, camera,  interface  and security. I really  recommend  this phone to you.  Everything from the charger to the phone is made in India which is important  in itself.

  Its' around 15days of using phone. everything looks fine but Samsung has integrated some bloatware in its UI which will show full screen ads every time you unlock your phone, even ads are appearing during you using your phone. And worst part you can't get rid of them. Samsung must have clarified before selling that they have installed these bloatwares. I have read on internet that even Samsung's flagship phones are having these bloatware installed. VERY DISAPPOINTING MOVE FROM SAMSUNG. IT WII GIVE ADVANTAGE TO 'ONPLUS AND OPPO' OVER SAMSUNG. Till date ONEPLUS and Flagship phones of OPPO doesn't have these types of apps.

  The phone feels amazing on the hand and could visually compete with any higher end phones on the market. Everything is great but a couple of things to note:1. There is only one speaker and it is placed at the worst place possible. Right below at the right hand side corner. You will tend to cover the speaker with your thumb when you are holding it normally, which will completely block the sound.2. The indoor photos didn't produce great results. Some of the photos were shaky and focus was slightly off even with the firm hands.

  The phone is amazing, too many features to explore yet, Camer quality is too good, Monster shot features is Super fun, charger is a fast charger, Dual sim, Smart lock, lock unlock button has fingure Print sensor , worth for money.The packing comes with A phone, Fast charger, manual and sim slot opener. The packing done by Amazon was safe and perfect ??

  I always had good experience with Samsung mobile phones compared to other brands like Mi, Asus or LG. M31S in another good addition to budget phones with some premium phone features available to use. Battery life is excellent. Camera is really good. AOLED screen gives sharp and crystal clear view. What to say more?
",,

  This is my first SAMSUNG Smartphone which I ordered on 8th Sept and received very quickly on the 12th even it was a village address. Kudus to the Amazon delivery.Though the M31s processor may not be great for gaming etc it’s good for normal usage. All my other concerns of M31 were overcome by M31s like punch hole camera, side fingerprint, 25 w charger, attractive design with side frame etc. Also Sony IMX 682 sensor and new camera features were add on.Also in Amazon sale got it for just 500 more than M31 and 500 less than Redmi note 9 pro max during a normal sale when I intended to buy 2 monthsago… (6/128 model)I had also considered Poco X2 coz of its camera but was put off by its 4500 mah battery. Many users had issues with battery drain also. But if I had purchased Redmi note 9 pro max, Poco X2 or even Motorola one fusion plus or Realme 6 I would have deeply missed my Lenovo P2s super AMOLED display…..All these Chinese brand phones though have good Snapdragon processors but have very poor IPS display which r no match to super AMOLED display. I have seen and compared few IPS display phones with family and friends with my Lenovo P2 super AMOLED display…..there is a day and night difference….So if I had gone with Redmi note 9 pro max I would have missed super AMOLED display and sony sensor…in Samsung m31s I will miss Snapdragon processor…btw my 3.5 yrs old Lenovo P2 is having Snapdragon 625….Its super power-efficient and smooth for day-to-day tasks and heavy multitasking..never played any games though....hope Exynos processor will at least match S625 if not more.I ordered it on 6th Aug around 12.15 am…. was delivered on 8th Aug…..first impression is very good especially the camera… excellent super AMOLED display….even a lot better than my Lenovo P2 super AMOLED display….built quality is the best in M series with new stylish dual colours and also has a side frame….but can’t b compared to glass backs which r just awesome but very fragile in reality….. anyways how many of us use mobile without case…..so this shall not make any impact for potential buyers of M31S…......case is must for M31s coz back though looks like glass is plastic and will easily get scratches.Battery is also excellent....being a Lenovo P2 user for 3.5 yrs I think finally I got a good successor for it. Can't really tell the battery screen on time coz I am installing my 100 plus apps and logging in. Today charged from 21% to 100% in 1.36 hrs....so from 0 to 100, it might take 1.55 hrs to max 2 hrs...huge important over M31 which had the same battery but would take 2.45 hrs to fully charge.Fingerprint is good….it's fast but u need to touch it correctly….but I am getting used to side-mounted fingerprint…it will take some time as I had front (below the display) fingerprint in my Lenovo P2.Rear camera is excellent. I am still checking out its features. Intelli cam with single take is quite interesting and helpful during important private moments.Indoor selfies are excellent-provided there is enough artificial light…. without much light it’s avg like any other mid-range phone….if we use front flash (white screen) when lighting is less then photo come very sharp and gud but with little boosted colours like what normally redmi and realme back cameras do….I am not a gamer…..for normal apps and multi-tasking there is no delay at all….hope in the long run it remains the same…I am still a little doubtful abt Exynos processor after few months….but this processor is tried and tested by Samsung in many phones so hoping for the best…

  Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.

  I have ordered this mobile on 6th August 2020 (prime day sale) and received on August 13th.I'm using this mobile for past one week.I would like to say about the cons first and pros lastly. Its my honest views and opinions.Cons:1. There's no back case provided even for 21k we are paying!2. Camera quality is not good all the times. Only works well for certain ranges. When zoomed bit and taking a pic, quality is very poor. Front camera absolutely ridiculous all the times.3. Battery is not upto the marketed numbers. Eventhough im not a heavy gamer, I watch movies and always keep my internet on. But it's okay to run through your day and 20% battery remains when I hit my bed.4. Heating issues initially. But after few days of usage, we will get used to that. Not that much heat dissipated, but still its there5. Face recognition is not working well. When we are in bright room its working perfect. But its supposed to work in normal daylight. But its not reading well. Disappointed from this perspective.6. Vertical size of mobile is huge and sometimes during call, receiver didnt heard me properly due to the size. Mic at the downside is not close to mouth.This phone comes with many pros..Pros:1. Wonderful display. Can't match this display with another mobile on this segment. Samsung wins by miles when competed with other mobiles.2. User interface. I am a apple user, and I didnt find any difficulty while using this mobile.Samsungs one UI 2.0 running on Android 10 is smooth and pretty much easy to work with. Very user friendly. Comes with very less bloatwares when compared with other Chinese mobiles. But still we can Uninstal or disable when not needed.3. Rear Camera. Single take option is cool. Its very good to have this option. Night mode works decent. Macro shots were awesome when clicked 5cm from object. Live photo looks cool. Overall we have many options to take pics..4. 25 watt Super fast charging. Spot on. It took exactly 100 minutes to charge my mobile from 5%-100%. But when charged without super fast charging, it took close to 3 hours to charge my mobile from 2-100% which is expected. So I would suggest to use normal charging once in a week.5. Build quality is solid even when it's a glasstick. Looks is premium. In hand feel is good.6. 3.5 mm jack is still plus. I always prefer headphone jack while traveling. So its definitely a great addition.7. Wifi calling option, always on display, Dolby atmo(only for headphones) are good additions8. Though Front camera quality is not good, the placement of front cam is perfect and gives premium look. Also when watching movies, it gives good feel of watching without any disturbance unlike water drop notch9. Fingerprint sensor works perfect. Really quick and initially it was difficult. But when we get used to this, its really good and feasible to use.10. Software updates. I read on a blog, Samsung has promised 4 years of security patch and till Android 12. So I believe this and super happy for that.Verdict:Recommended- for moderate gamers, movie lovers, non Chinese brand seekers, battery centric, decent camera quality seekers.Not Recommend- heavy gamers, photography enthusiasts and those chinese brand seekers.

  Star rating : 4.5 out of 5Pros :-I. Battery department is top notch1. 6000 mAh Powerful battery2. 25 watt super fast charging (I personallydon't like charger faster than this as thatwould degrade the battery health rapidly)3. USB C to C charging cable with reversecharging.II. Display : No other brand phone can come close to Samsung one in this category even when it has 60 hertz refresh rate.1.It comes with a FHD+ sAMOLED whichis one of the best and neary edge toedge .2. Infinity O camera cut out looks waybetter than the predecessor's m30 andmakes the phone look gorgeous.III. Camera : considering the price I find the both the front and rear cameras to be quiet good. Front one is a 32 MP camera.and in the rear quad setup, the primary sensor is the SONY IMX682 with an f/1.8 lens. The secondary sensor is a 12MP ultra wide lens. And other two are 5MP each depth & macro lens.IV. Side Mounted finger print scanner is absolutely quicker & convenient than the under display ones.V. Base varient with 128gb storage & 6GB RAM will surely be more than enough for most of the users. If not then one can always insert a Micro SD card ( SIM1 + SIM2 + SD card type slot)VI. Presence of headphone jack is still an advantage. ??Cons : -1. Samsung should have used at least Gorilla glass 5 instead of the 3.2. The Exynos 9611 chipset is same as the predecessor's M30. Snapdragon chipset would have been appreciated.3. No OIS or EIS is available for either of the cameras4. No NFC/wireless charging/water resistance rating (I know demanding these at this price point is ridiculous as of 2020, just mentioned to inform )5. Packaging is pretty cheap and biggest con is that it doesn't comes with a TPU case. ????6. Complete plastic body or ""glasstic"".7. Price : It could have been at least ? 1000 cheaper if Samsung tried ( within a month or two price is certainly going to get reduced as sales season are also coming??)Got this phone for my mother and she is pretty happy with it.I would happily recommend it to anyone over any dominant chinese phone in this segment.#SayNo2Chinese wherever possible.

  Honestly, the selfie camera works too much poor inside the rooms (like a 5MP camera). No AI in selfie camera. If you are a selfie lover, you will be 100% disappointed. Phone doesn't have features like screen recording features, schedule turn off and turn on, don't have much customization. During whatsapp video call inside the room, it feels that selfie camera is 2MP. (TRUST ME). In outdoor it works fine.Very nice main camera.Very nice themes.Battery also gives 10 hour of screentime.

  An excellent perfectly suited phone for me. I have been using this mobile since approx 2 months and i am very well impressed with the overall performance.Firstly, the processing speed, it reaches its expectations as it was mentioned. No lag and no delay and no heat.Fingerprint sensor., i had an issue with it and i contacted samsung support through chat and they gave some workaround tips to rectify and its now working fine after an update.Battery life, OMG..its awesome. Even with 5 percent battery you can still play games, take pics and handle calls for one hour. A full day charge giving one day of maximum usage and two days of optimistic use.Camera..i dont use much but i observed a great quality and better picture.Weight...i have been habituated but its not tooo heavy.Sound and picture clarity is asusually good as they have dolby atmos and sAMOLED screen.

  Pros- Awesome design feels premium in hand. Fast charger in box, quad camera setup and nice camera quality, 6000mah battery, fast fingerprint sensor and face unlockCons-1. No any back case in box,2. No earphone in box

  Hi I have purchased Samsung Galaxy M31S on Samsung New Launch in Amzone Prime on Aug 06 2020 with price of 20000Rs after discount of 2000 . I would like to share few pros and cons after using this for 20 days.Pros1. Battery backup is good minimum 1.1/2 day with excess usage.2. Battery charge 100 percent in 1 1.2 hours.3. Front Facing Camera good4. Display was good.5. Performance was good not badCons1. Fingure Print Scanner is disaster in this model.Fingure print scanner having issue some times It won't recognise it's irritating.2. Fingure Print Scanner is at right side of pannel so it's keep on displaying when u kept in pocket to unlock which will be irritating to switch of display.3. Heating issues identified after a a video call for more than 5 min disgusting.4. Sometimes Network issues.5. No back case & Front screen guard will be given.For an expensive mobile like this one should atleast give a back case.6. Touch problemsI hope this Fingure Print scanner needs an software update I feel but over all better not to go with this model. Lots of issues samsung rectify problems u fooled customers.One more issue identified ...network drops suddenly while using it is confirmed handset issue. Two many flaws in this version hope samsung will soon loose it's reputation. Only one sentiment not to buy chaina mobile I prefered samsung. That's bad idea.

  SAMSUNG J2 CORE A DISAPPOINTING PHONE FROM SO CALLED TECH GIANT. ??I bought this for my mother to introduce her to world of internet. When i bought it, i thought it was a proper phone for a beginner. The price we pay (Rs. 6299/-) was reasonable enough. But believe me, you get what you pay for. This is a pretty ordinary phone. But most disgusting thing is the company's manual projected it as 4G LTE FDD/TDD phone, but ACTUALLY it is LTE/3G/2G. It is not a 4G phone at all. The internet works very slow on this phone. I gave my mother a 4G 1.5 gb per day data pack, but it is of no use to her. Purpose for this phone was that my mother could watch youtube videos for recipes, devotional videos, but being a non 4G phone, the internet is of no use to her. I have to provide wifi network from my phone, to enable her to watch videos.* IN SHORT, SAMSUNG HAS FOOLED ME BY OFFERING ME AN LTE PHONE BY CLAIMING THAT IT IS AN 4G PHONE.FRIENDS IT IS NOT A 4G PHONE. ITS OF NO USE FOR SURFING ETC. ITS JUST A BASIC FEATURE PHONE WITH A TOUCHSCREEN.SAMSUNG J2 CORE IS A DISAPPOINTMENT.

  Worst network strength, Lava n Honor phones are much better in Jio network in low coverage areas. Camera is excellent but touch response is not good. Most negative part is network strength which will very very very weaker than competition brands in same low coverage areas. Didn't expect that in A series, shame....

",,
"

  The Samsung a10s is a good phone. The screen is very sharp and bright, although it is not amoled but is very good. Camera quality is OK. But that's okay with such a budget. Speakers are loud enough and battery life is long. It easily lasts me a day. It has a low sar value(amount of radiation) which is great. Normally Redmi smartphones have quite high sar value which is harmful for us. The performance was slow first but when I turned off animations in developer settings it became quite fast.Overall satisfied.

",,
"

  Touch has issue randomly. Have to touch multiple times to get a thing work. This happens very rarely, so I hope this will be fixed with furure software update

",,
"

  Performance is not good, touch is also having some problem. Not worth for this price. Chinese companies are giving much better at this price. Had to buy this because I didnt want to puchase a chinese product

  The phone doesn't charge well . Defected item.. it doesn't charge more than 40% never buy phones from Amazon

  This is a good Samsung phone, not a knock off. In factory sealed packaging, manufacture in 2019, appears to be intended for the Vietnamese market. All documentation is in Vietnamese. The charger is useless in North America, has 2 pins on it for the Aisian market.The quality and performance is what I would expect from this vintage of Samsung product (A10 series) . I bought the A10S for its dual SIM capability.Used Samsung Switch for phone data transfer with no issues. Some apps may need fine tuning depending on what version of the Android OS you are upgrading from. Camera works well for 13MP as does 2MP close up. Blue tooth and WiFi are seamless. Automatic SD card read/write works well. Using 136 GB..Curved screen is fragile and I would recommend a dual layer case meeting Mil-spec drop tests and a curved glass screen protector.

",,
"

  Pleasantly surprised it arrived fast.. Unfortunately unsealed... I've bought several phones with Amazon over the years always sealed! Not this one..  and not compatible with Freedom Mobile.  Other than that appears to be a great little phone for the price!

",,
"

  Extremely happy with this purchase. This phone is very nice for the price and you wouldn't know it was so cheap. The features are great the fingerprint and face reader works wonderfully. The battery life is excellent. Photos come out great and the HD when watching videos is excellent as well. The sound quality is nice too I was expecting it to be not so great from another review but it's fine to me.

",,
"

  Great budget phone. Takes good photos. Good battery life. Mobile games look great. Had a Xiaomi Redmi 5 before this one and no regrets switching to the Galaxy A10S. Can't beat this phone in the 200$ price range.

",,
"

  Great phone for basic uses. Light and easy with simple functions. Battery life can go 2 days without charge. Amazon always delivers with impeccable timing especially during a pandemic.

",,
"

  I love this phone... except it took me about 4 hours to get everything sorted and fixed . The phones camera wouldnt open kept crashing . I didn't want to return the product just wanted the camera to work. I contacted Amazon on the phone with them almost 1and half hours. They couldn't help me. On the phone with samsung for about 45 mins on hold without any agent answering. FINALLLLLLLY I figured it out with no help from seller at all. Disappointed there's no way to call the seller and speak to a person either. Otherwise I lovehat it's all working. Definitely worth the money. You won't find another phone in this price range like it .. you do have to do all the initial setup but it's worth the while

",,
"

  Great phone for the price, lots of features, camera is great and also screen quality.Battery life is so so, but not too bad.

",,
"

  Great phone, no scratches. Dual sim. Sound is low. Not as bright as some phones. Also, box was open. Micro USB port. American standard plug. Again, box was open so not sure if it was new.

  Got this phone for my son who needed a starter phone. Works great?

  I replaced my daughter's iPhone 8 with this phone. She loves it. The price is great and it does everything that a teen need a phone for

  Taught for my mother she loves it

  Seriously, ordered this a couple months ago (return window closed). We went out for dinner, my Son left his phone at home on the dresser and we came home to find it like this. I suspect if the phone was plugged in or fully charged it would have been much worse. Avoid this model.

",,
"

  Great phone for the price I've had this phone for a little while now and I would definitely recommend it to anybody for the price it's an excellent phone the battery lasts forever and I'm on it's quite a bit so it's definitely worth the money.

  I liked the overall design of the phone the size and how it foods in the hand. The speaker on the phone is loud that's a good thing and out did not come with all kindsof bloat ware, but I'm not to much on the fingerprint or face scanner and also the image for video playback is poor quality compared to my prepaid lg k8. That's why I give it a 4 star. Other wise a really good phone.

  This was an an interim phone that I was hoping to last for 6 months - 1 year, unfortunately, it only made it to six weeks, as I was taking a call. The phone had plenty of battery at the time of the call but died with no warning and has remained unresponsive. The most unfortunate part is that we were two weeks out of our full refund period of 4 weeks and company agreed to a partial refund to repair the phone.No repair shop has been able to repair the phone and the  company refuse a full refund, therefore we are out of pocket, I appreciate this is a cheap phone but I would expect a company to want to know the reason for malfunctions, they denied our offer to return the phone. This is very disappointing. I am now put off Samsung and this buyer.The tamper label was broken which I assumed ok as it was international, the fingerprint scanner worked intermittently and the face recognition was poor. I do not recommend the phone for all reasons above. My latest plea to the company regarding a refund was ignored so customer service poor too. Shame, I'd rather write a positive review. Back to Apple it is ;)

  Dad loves it so much, he's very cautious when using it.

  Excelente articulo, lo recomiendo

  It is absolutely perfect. I expected something very low quality because of 2G RAM and low price. In practice it is very close to my iPhone 11, on my regular activities I don’t feel the difference. Samsung did a bomb.

",,
"

  Good

",,
"

  I bought this phone for a back up, burner phone, but so far it looks like it may replace my Samsung S7 Edge.  I a if over $600 for my S7 Edge and o my $149.00 for my A10s.  I also want to take it on out of country trips, so the dual SIM card and being unlocked makes it alot easier to use the local SIM card (10-15 USD) in Costa Rica.

  I just used it yesterday  seems  everything ok

  El cable del celluar de cargar llego defectuso  ,por lo demas  llego  todo bien  y trajo audifonos  exelente  compra .

  Excellent phone from Samsung Galaxy. Great buy . Phone performs as expected. I love it.

",,
"

  This phone was sent overseas , but now the speaker doesn't  work at all. I just invest money in a problem. We need to be careful what we buy everytime.

",,
"

  Good quality and it came fast

",,
"

  It is not an unlocked phone and does not work with any carrier!

",,
"

  If you are in the U.S do not buy this phone it is not made for the U.S.Nice phone but only has 2-3G gets bad reception and poor internet service if you are in the U.S.

",,
"

  Muy bueno, tiene buen tamaño y precio, solo falta probarlo

",,
"

  I was sold a faulty phone. It doesnt connect to the wifi. It appeared after the 30 days so i cant return it. Dont waste your money.

",,
"

  It doesn't call or have any information on how to set up the phone on how to get it to work?????? It wont give any information on which carrier it's from?

",,
"

  I bought this phone for a friend of mine, he loves it so much! He’s not used to “newer phones”! Only waited about 5 days for it to arrive also!

  Brought this for my sister in HaitiWorks wonder she loves it

Great phone a little heavy in hand but good . One hand usage is difficult if u have small / medium fingers . You need long fingers to use by single hand . Battery charging takes time but it equally slow . Moderate usage u can use the mobile for 2 days . The back surface is a finger print magnet . I wouldnt advice to use this phone without cover . I m using this phone for office work so not much of gaming so cant comment on that .READ MORE,,

"First impression: Wow... Thanks Flipkart for timely delivery. Now about the phone (I know it's too early to make a statement based on just 1 day of use). But can't stop myself in sharing the pros:- Big screen, amazing camera, super loud and clear speakers,  Dual Sim(five star for providing 2 seperate trays for sim cards), memory card slot(not hybrid but a separate provision for memory card), dual front camera for wide angle pic, exceptionally bright display and all other standard samsung func...READ MORE",,
"Using this phone for the past 10 days. It's main highlight was the camera, which is absolutely great. with a 16+5mp rear combo you can click some great shots. Low light capability is also very good. Front camera is decent but could have been much better. The Super AMOLED display is awesome and has a good amount of sharpness. In the case of prossesor, the Snapdragon 450 is decent, but not great. They could go with a higher version of chipset considering the price. But It can handle heavy games...READ MORE",,
if you are a game lover and movie lover then it will disappoint you. I am using this phone from last few days so now I am in a position to put my opinion about this O8 or J8 because both the phones are same. Pros: 1- Decent battery Life 2- Fits easily in the palm unlike other phones which are hard to handle with one hand 3- Renowned Brand satisfaction  4- post purchase customer support. 5- Super Amoled display   Cons: HD+ display in this price range. oooh come on samsung in half of its price ...READ MORE,,
"Best AMOLED Display phone at this price range with all basic requirement & performance. Good Camera, Screen Size, Sound Quality & Design. Only two things missing are fast charging facility and 4K Video recording / Slo-mo. But for this price, a Samsung brand with good battery & display is highly recommended. Very much satisfied.READ MORE",,

"This device is better than other chinese products. build quality, hardware and softwares are even good. battery backup is even better. i gave 4 star instead of 5 star because of it should have atleast notification led light sensor and quick charging option as well. face unlock is little slow but it doesn't open the device when your eyes would  be close so it is more secure than one plus oppo vivo mi and other chinese devices.READ MORE",,

At first I want to say honestly that Flipkart is a third class  cheat company. Never buy any electronic product from Flipkart. It doesn't make a refund even after a faulty product received. Flipkart simply fools the customers. Kindly avoid purchasing electronic goods from Flipkart. Once you got a faulty product than think that your money has just gone. We are paying for a right product not for a faulty product. So beware brothers and sisters.READ MORE,,
