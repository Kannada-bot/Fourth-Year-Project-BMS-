Worth every penny,"I was in confusion..should but i buy  this phone or other phone like redmi,honor 9n,nokia x6.....720p display is in specs but dude dont see the specs ..its samsungAnd camera is outstanding  far better  than their    competitor's....battery is good...screen is very good....u will love samsung experience  version.....u can play PUBG... nothing to lose....and the main thing this phone will not let u go service  centre coz it's  a samsung device...if u find this helpful let me know..pls thmbs upREAD MORE"
Great product,"First impression: Wow... Thanks Flipkart for timely delivery. Now about the phone (I know it's too early to make a statement based on just 1 day of use). But can't stop myself in sharing the pros:- Big screen, amazing camera, super loud and clear speakers,  Dual Sim(five star for providing 2 seperate trays for sim cards), memory card slot(not hybrid but a separate provision for memory card), dual front camera for wide angle pic, exceptionally bright display and all other standard samsung func...READ MORE"
Classy product,"Using this phone for the past 10 days. It's main highlight was the camera, which is absolutely great. with a 16+5mp rear combo you can click some great shots. Low light capability is also very good. Front camera is decent but could have been much better. The Super AMOLED display is awesome and has a good amount of sharpness. In the case of prossesor, the Snapdragon 450 is decent, but not great. They could go with a higher version of chipset considering the price. But It can handle heavy games...READ MORE"
Just okay,if you are a game lover and movie lover then it will disappoint you. I am using this phone from last few days so now I am in a position to put my opinion about this O8 or J8 because both the phones are same. Pros: 1- Decent battery Life 2- Fits easily in the palm unlike other phones which are hard to handle with one hand 3- Renowned Brand satisfaction  4- post purchase customer support. 5- Super Amoled display   Cons: HD+ display in this price range. oooh come on samsung in half of its price ...READ MORE
Super!,"Best AMOLED Display phone at this price range with all basic requirement & performance. Good Camera, Screen Size, Sound Quality & Design. Only two things missing are fast charging facility and 4K Video recording / Slo-mo. But for this price, a Samsung brand with good battery & display is highly recommended. Very much satisfied.READ MORE"
Nice product,good product under 17k with super amoled display.....I always suggest that if you want a mid range good phone with good display then u buy it....READ MORE
Terrific purchase,Good smartphone with best performance. Very light. No heating issues after  1hour of gaming. Best battery life. I recommend to buy this smartphone instead of j8. Value for money with every features loaded.READ MORE
Worth the money,"This device is better than other chinese products. build quality, hardware and softwares are even good. battery backup is even better. i gave 4 star instead of 5 star because of it should have atleast notification led light sensor and quick charging option as well. face unlock is little slow but it doesn't open the device when your eyes would  be close so it is more secure than one plus oppo vivo mi and other chinese devices.READ MORE"
Samsung infinity on 8,Very nice phone and good packing we r fully satisfied with this product thank u flip kartREAD MORE
Terrific purchase,"Galaxy on 8  infinity is really   an awesome smart phone by samsung ,  camera quality is too good, battery backup is also nice ,  appearance of the phone is also premium,  but delievery by  flipkart was was late and also no back case Cover provided in the box, also the Samsung should have given notch  in this phone as other phone in this range have this feature. Overall  the phone provides  full value oh  moneyREAD MORE"
Super!,"its a very nice mobile having stunning performance and the battery backup is also superb,you can click low light selfie,also the display is just awesome. All you can say that the samsung has given a very good fixes and improvement this time in J8 and On 8 ...its totally similar as J8 ,having no difference .READ MORE"
Wonderful,"I brought this phone for 13500/- on offer. Nice look, good camera, display is ok. Camera is better than redmi note5pro in some aspects, because note5pro add some artificial colors. In on8 photos are in natural color. Samsung OS is user friendly. worth for 13500/-. Better than chines brands. classy product. Go for it.READ MORE"
Wonderful,"1st Android based phone I got in 2010 i.e. Samsung Galaxy 3 (Eclair 2.1 OS) and after using it till 2012 end, tried for other brands till 2018 until I got this on8 (2018). The software interface (Samsung Experience) just outperforms Samsung Touchwiz and other top on skin from other manufacturers.

Simply awesome,"First of all... my sincere thanks to Flipkart for bang on time delivery and for giving the offer for which I bought in huge discount. The best thing about the phone is its battery. the 100% charging was completed at 2.50 a.m. and it's 9:00 a.m. but the battery is still bang on 100%, even after taking some cells and playing some music (though it's just a very less than a normal usage). super AMOLED screen is just mindblowing and camera is just excellent!... fingerprint scanner is very fast and...READ MORE"

Terrific purchase,Ordered this mobile for my father who is conversant with android and using an old version of it that was making his earlier samsung smartphone  slow. he is happy with the new android interface and the customization possible on this dual sim volte mobile. Impressed with the RAM and the ROM..although a 5000Mah battery would be nice on a big screened mobile such as this still for its features and brand..the price is reasonable and there is no lag with many apps open simultaneously.READ MORE

Unsatisfactory,At first I want to say honestly that Flipkart is a third class  cheat company. Never buy any electronic product from Flipkart. It doesn't make a refund even after a faulty product received. Flipkart simply fools the customers. Kindly avoid purchasing electronic goods from Flipkart. Once you got a faulty product than think that your money has just gone. We are paying for a right product not for a faulty product. So beware brothers and sisters.READ MORE
